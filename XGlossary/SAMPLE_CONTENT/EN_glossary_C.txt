 |shortdesc=A context is a “role” subdivision of the {{Literal|Button}} window, regrouping common settings of current selected/active object(s).
 |longdesc=For example, in the {{Glossary/Link|ref=buttons window|txt={{Literal|Buttons}} window}}, you have a {{Literal|Shading}} context ({{Shortcut|F5}}) regrouping everything about lighting, materials and textures. Or a {{Literal|Editing}} context ({{Shortcut|F9}}) with all settings and tools concerning the edition of an object, or its mesh/control points/…<br />Note that contexts can be further subdivided in {{Glossary/Link|ref=sub context|txt=sub-contexts}}, when there are many things (like for the {{Literal|Shading}} one, for example).
