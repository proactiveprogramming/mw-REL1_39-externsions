# Localization

Add languages as necessary. English is the source language for translations,
all other languages are targets. Norwegian BokmÃ¥l is an example target language.

## Glossary

If you need a glossary, a lot of the terms are technical jargon, one is defined at
[mw:Help:Expect/Glossary](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Expect/Glossary).

## Templates

There should be a template `expect-gloss` reading (with additional markup)

> Please check out the
> [https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Help:Expect/Glossary glossary]
> and try to be consistent.
