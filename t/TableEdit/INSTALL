INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Download the TableEdit extension.  A link to the download is at
   http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:TableEdit

2. Unpack the downloaded file using gunzip or another unpacking program.
   ( You've probably already gotten this far. Good job.)

3. Move the unpacked TableEdit directory to your MediaWiki extensions
   directory. 

4. If you don't already have an AdminSettings.php file in your MediaWiki
   installation directory, create one. This contains the database admin 
   username and password for your MediaWiki database. TableEdit needs this
   information to create some tables in the database. 
   [[ see http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/AdminSettings.php ]] 
   
5. Backup your MediaWiki database. This is an important step in case anything
   goes wrong. 
   [[ see http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Backup ]]

6. Get to your extensions/TableEdit directory and run the install.php
   script:

     php install.php -w /path/to/your/wiki

   The -w parameter is the path to your MediaWiki installation.  This is
   usually "../.." from the extensions/TableEdit directory.
   
   Right now TableEdit has only been tested using MySQL. If you are using 
   a different database server, you may want to have a look in the sql/ 
   directory for the sql files and create these tables by hand.

7. Add the following lines to your LocalSettings.php file:

   # TableEdit extension
       require_once( $path_to_extensions . "TableEdit/TableEdit.php" );
   # Make Mediawiki create valid tables
       require_once( $path_to_extensions . "TableEdit/modules/TableMarkerUpper.php");	

     
   The $path_to_extensions variable is not needed unless you put your 
   extensions somewhere besides the extensions/ directory.
			
8. Test it.  Try it out by making a new table with the wiki-markup:	
	
     <newTableEdit>
     Heading1
     Heading2
     Heading3
     </newTableEdit>

9. Have a look at the documentation at [[ http://gmod.org/TableEdit ]]




Known Issues:

1. Images not showing correctly
   Sometimes the images in the TableEdit directory need to be moved to a place inside your webroot (if the extension lives in a non-standard place.) You can copy the images to an accessible place, but remember to change the paths in the main.css file.
