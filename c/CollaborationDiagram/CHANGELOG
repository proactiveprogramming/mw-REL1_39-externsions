This is a changelog for Collaboration diagram versions. The last version is on the top.

###################################################################
=== Version 0.2 ===
Lots of new features here. In this version I've added some new views and skins, fixed a lot of bugs and made the diagram
hopefully much prettier. The very notable new feature is optional dependency from SocialProfile extension.
====New features====
* new views: compact view with only icons of articles and people and SocialProfile view with big shiny avatars.
* new graphviz skins for newbies in graphviz: circular, vertical and more.
* new configuration variables
* support Vector wikis
* namespace support
* support wikis with prefixes in table names

=== Version 0.1 ===
The first experimental version that works pretty often.  Supports skins but nobody cares.
