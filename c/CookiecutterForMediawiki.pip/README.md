# cookiecutter-mediawiki-extension

A [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) template for
MediaWiki extensions.

## Features
* Comes with all features of the [upstream BoilerPlate](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:BoilerPlate)
  extension (only english i18n, see `i18n/README.md`).
* Makefile support (`make help`, `make install`, `make update`, `make test`)

## Features (future)
* License support
* Tests using PHPUnit

## Optional Integrations
*These features can be enabled during initial project setup.*

* Set the extension type
    * [Parser Functions](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Parser_functions) (parserhook)
    * [Special Pages](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Special_pages) (specialpage)
    * [Tag Extensions](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Tag_extensions) (not sure?! please help)
    * … and more!
* Add an example special page `[[Special:HelloWorld]]`
* Add an example parser hook `{{#something: }}`
* Integration with [Gerrit](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Gerrit) (using git-review)

## Constraints
* Cannot create MediaWiki skins. See [cookiecutter-mediawiki-skin](https://github.com/JonasGroeger/cookiecutter-mediawiki-skin/)
for that. (In theory, you can select the skin option, but it doesent do
anything special for skins right now. A separate repository is better imho.)

## Usage
Let's pretend you want to create a MediaWiki extension called "SomeExtension".
Rather than cloning the [BoilerPlate extension](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:BoilerPlate),
and then changing every occurrence of `BoilerPlate` by hand, use [cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter)
to do all the work.

First, get cookiecutter. Trust me, it's awesome:

    $ pip install cookiecutter

Now run it against this repo:

    $ cookiecutter https://github.com/JonasGroeger/cookiecutter-mediawiki-extension.git

You'll be prompted for some questions, answer them, then it will create a
custom MediaWiki extension for you.

**Note**: If you want to conform with all naming conventions (PHP, JS/CSS,
Composer) you should watch closely when filling out the project template
parameters. The default values are conforming with all conventions.

It prompts you for questions. Answer them:

    $ cookiecutter https://github.com/JonasGroeger/cookiecutter-mediawiki-extension.git

Enter the project and take a look around:

    $ cd SomeExtension/
    $ ls

Create a GitHub repo and push it there:

    $ git init
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Initial commit: MediaWiki extension SomeExtension"
    $ git remote add origin git@github.com:JonasGroeger/SomeExtension.git
    $ git push -u origin master

Now take a look at your repo. Don't forget to carefully look at the generated
README.md. Awesome, right?
