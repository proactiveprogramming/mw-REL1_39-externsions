This extension provides in-browser editing of uploaded SVG files using the very nice
open-source SVG-edit widget:

  http://code.google.com/p/svg-edit/

A master copy of SVG-Edit from Google Code is used, embedded in an iframe.

You may wish to make your own copy of SVG-Edit, either in this subdirectory or elsewhere;
if so set $wgSVGEditEditor to point at the 'svg-editor.html' file.

Current versions of most major browsers should work except for Internet Explorer 8 and below.

Known bugs:
* Actual editor issues belong upstream: http://code.google.com/p/svg-edit/

Todo:
* add an editor trigger on SVG images visible in regular page views
* allow saving without closing the editor
* autosave & recover drafts
* allow choosing the filename before saving
