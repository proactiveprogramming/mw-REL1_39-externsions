# SOME RULES:
#	- Each version of an experiment must have exactly one control group.
#	- Treatment groups can be grown from one version of an experiment to the next, but none of them can shrink. This is to make sure that the data is statistically valid.
#	- Treatment groups can add up to as much as 100%, but will typically be much less (eg: two groups of 4% each). The rest of the users will be untracked but see the control-group experience.
#	- Google Analytics tracking is totally optional for an experiment.
#		- If your experiment is going to be tracked in Google Analytics, you can NOT change treatment_group sizes in-flight. This would give you bad data. You either should switch to using the data warehouse for tracking or create a new experiment with the different sizes (yes, this will require re-coding the js constants & redeploying).
