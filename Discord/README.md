# Discord (mw-discord)
MediaWiki extension for sending notifications to a Discord webhook from MediaWiki. When a certain event occurs on your MediaWiki wiki, including new edits, they can be sent as a message to a channel on a Discord server using a webhook.

Multiple webhook URLs are supported and messages will be sent to all of them.

**Live demo**: https://runescape.wiki (https://discord.gg/runescapewiki)

## Requirements
- **Discord webhook URL**: This can be obtained by editing a channel on a server with the correct permissions.
- **MediaWiki 1.36+**. This extension aims to support the latest LTS release. **Ensure you are using the correct branch of this extension for your MediaWiki version. The `master` branch includes changes only applicable for the latest MediaWiki version.**

### Recommended
- **cURL**: By default, this extension sends requests using cURL. If you don't have cURL, you could try setting `$wgDiscordUseFileGetContents` to `true` instead, but this is not recommended.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your MediaWiki installation's `extensions` folder using `git clone https://github.com/jaydenkieran/mw-discord.git -b REL1_35 Discord`
2. Modify your `LocalSettings.php` file and add:

```php
// Load the extension
wfLoadExtension( 'Discord' );
// Set the webhook URL(s) (string or array)
$wgDiscordWebhookURL = [ '' ];
```

For further configuration variables, see [below](#configuration).

### Getting a webhook URL
To get a webhook URL for use with this extension, open the Discord client and go to a server where you have the `Manage Webhooks` permission. Click the cog icon when hovering over a text channel, switch to the Webhooks tab on the left of the interface, and click 'Create webhook'. The webhook URL can then be copied from that interface.

## Configuration
This extension can be configured using the `LocalSettings.php` file in your MediaWiki installation.

## Translation
This extension can be translated through the messages in the `Ã¬18n` folder if you're a developer. As a wiki administrator, you may find it a better option to edit the messages on-site in the MediaWiki namespace.

Any excess whitespace in text that is translated will be stripped (e.g double spaces, etc).
