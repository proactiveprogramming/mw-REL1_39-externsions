  abstract = {Abstract: Eutectic mixtures of quaternary ammonium salts with Lewis
	or Brnsted acids have been described as ionic liquid, but doubt exists
	over the compositional range for which this description is valid.
	In the current work, the conductivity, viscosity, density, and surface
	tension of a number of glycolic mixtures with choline chloride are
	measured over the mole fraction range 0 to 0.33. The data are fitted
	to hole theory, and it is proposed that the composition at which
	the measured conductivity matches the theoretical value is the point
	at which hole mobility becomes the dominant mechanism for charge
	mobility. For the mixtures of ethylene glycol and butanediol, this
	occurs at a ChCl mole fraction of approximately 0.2.},

  abstract = {Abstract: Recent developments in micro- and nanotechnologies made
	possible the fabrication of devices integrating a deterministic network
	of nanochannels, i.e., with at least one dimension in a range from
	1 to 100 nm. The proximity of this dimension and the Debye length,
	the size of biomolecules such as DNA or proteins, or even the slip
	length, added to the excellent control on the geometry gives unique
	features to nanofluidic devices. This new class of devices not only
	finds applications wherever less well-defined porous media, such
	as electrophoresis gels, have been traditionally used but also give
	a new insight into the sieving mechanisms of biomolecules and the
	fluid flow at the nanoscale. Beyond this, the control on the geometry
	allows smarter design resulting, among others, in new separation
	principles by taking advantage of the anisotropy. This perspective
	gives an overview on the fabrication technologies of nanofluidic
	devices and their applications. In the first part, the current state
	of the art of nanofluidic fabrication is presented. The second part
	first discusses the key transport phenomena in nanochannels. Current
	applications of nanofluidic devices are next discussed. Finally,
	future challenges and possible applications are highlighted.},

	The two parts are coupled by a simple dissipative force while the

	single polymer chain in a solvent are performed. The dynamic and
	static scaling properties predicted by analytical theory are validated.
	In this context, the influence of the finite size of the simulation
	box is discussed. While usually the finite size corrections scale
	as L-1 (L denoting the linear dimension of the box), the decay rate
	of the Rouse modes is only subject to an L-3 finite size effect.
	Furthermore, the mapping to an existing MD simulation of the same
	system is done so that all physical input values for the new method
	can be derived from pure MD simulation. Both methods can thus be
	compared quantitatively, showing that the new method allows for much

	This boundary condition is independent of the relaxation process

	boundary condition is extended to simulate slip-flows. The extended
	boundary condition has been tested and it is found that the slip
	length is independent of the shear rate and the density, and proportional
	to the BGK relaxation time. The method is used to study slip in Poiseuille
	flow and in linear shear flow. Patterned walls with stripes of different
	slip parameters are also studied, and an anisotropy of the slip length
	in accordance with the surface pattern is found. The angle dependence
	of the simulation results perfectly agrees with theoretical expectations.
	The results confirm that the proposed boundary conditions can be
	used for simulating slip-flows in micro fluidics using single relaxation
	time lattice Boltzmann, without any numerical slip, giving an accuracy
	of the second order. },

	length is modulated in stripes. We find that the effective slip length
	for such a flow can be expressed as a function of the individual
	slip lengths on the stripes. The angle dependence of the effective
	slip on a patterned surface is in excellent agreement with a recent
	theory describing the slip length as a tensorial quantity. We show
	that the tensorial nature of the effective slip length allows to
	induce a transverse flow, which can be used in micro mixers to drive
	a vortex. In our simulations of a flow through a square channel with
	patterned surfaces we see a homogeneous rotation about the direction
	of the flow which we quantify by the component of the curl in the

	through a device. We study flow past surfaces on which the slip length
	is modulated in stripes. We find that the effective slip length for
	such a flow can be expressed as a function of the individual slip
	lengths on the stripes. The angle dependence of the effective slip
	is in excellent agreement with a recent theory describing the slip
	length as a tensorial quantity. This tensorial nature allows to induce
	a transverse flow, which can be used in micro mixers to drive a vortex.
	In our simulations of a flow through a square channel with patterned
	surfaces we see a homogeneous rotation about the direction of the
	flow. We investigate the influence of patterns of cosine shaped varying
	local slip on the flow field depending on the orientation of the
	pattern and find the largest effective slip length for periods of
	stripes parallel to the flow direction.},

	The methods do not require a priori knowledge of the phase-space
	density and are suitable for equilibrium or nonequilibrium systems
	in stationary state. All the methods use a series of interfaces in
	phase space, between the initial and final states, to generate transition
	paths as chains of connected partial paths, in a ratchetlike manner.
	No assumptions are made about the distribution of paths at the interfaces.
	The three methods differ in the way that the transition path ensemble
	is generated. We apply the algorithms to kinetic Monte Carlo simulations
	of a genetic switch and to Langevin dynamics simulations of intermittently
	driven polymer translocation through a pore. We find that the three
	methods are all of comparable efficiency, and that all the methods
	are much more efficient than brute-force simulation.},

  abstract = {Boundary element methods are used to model the free solution electrophoretic
	mobility of short DNA fragments. The Stent surfaces of the DNA fragments
	are modeled as plated cylinders that reproduce translational and
	rotational diffusion constants. The solvent-accessible and ion-accessible
	surfaces are taken to be coincident with the Stern surface. The mobilities
	are computed by solving simultaneously the coupled Navier-Stokes,
	Poisson, and ion-transport equations. The equilibrium electrostatics
	are treated at the level of the full Poisson-Boltzmann equation and
	ion relaxation is included. For polyions as highly charged as short
	DNA fragments, ion relaxation is substantial. At .11 M KCl, the simulated
	mobilities of a 20 base pair DNA fragment are in excellent agreement
	with experiment. At .04 M Tris acetate, pH = 8.0, the simulated mobilities
	are about 10-15% higher than experimental values and this discrepancy
	is attributed to the relatively large size of the Tris counterion.
	The length dependence of the mobility at .11 M KCl is also investigated.
	Earlier mobility studies an lysozyme are reexamined in view of the
	presentfindings. In addition to electrophoretic mobilities, the effective
	polyion charge measured in steady state electrophoresis and its relationship
	to the preferential interaction parameter Gamma is briefly considered.

	chain, and adsorption from a bulk solution in theta solvent conditions.
	The behavior of flexible and semi-rigid chains is discussed separately
	and is expressed as function of the polymer and surface charges,
	ionic strength of the solution and polymer bulk concentration. We
	mainly review mean-field results and briefly comment about fluctuation
	effects. The phenomenon of polyelectrolyte adsorption on a planar
	surface as presented here is of relevance to the stabilization of
	colloidal suspensions. In this respect we also mention calculations
	of the inter-plate force between two planar surfaces in presence
	of polyelectrolyte. Finally, we comment on the problem of charge

	alternating positive and negative polyelectrolytes on planar surfaces

  abstract = {Osmotic properties of dilute salt-free solutions of stiff-chain polyelectrolytes
	are studied using computer simulations. A number of factors affecting
	the charge distribution around the macroions are analyzed quantitatively
	for parameters of an aqueous solution of a typical synthetic strongly
	charged rodlike polyelectrolyte. Departing from a mean-field treatment
	of an infinitely long linear charged rod, we significantly refine
	the model description. We found that incorporation of effects such
	as electrostatic correlations between counterions, chain flexibility,
	and addition of salt decreases the osmotic coefficient slightly.
	On the other hand, a model of a finite macroion with a noncentral
	charge distribution predicted significantly higher pressure. We quantify
	all these contributions separately and show what deviation one should
	expect from the prediction of the Poisson-Boltzmann solution of the
	infinite rod cell model. We further comment on the discrepancy between
	our simulation results and experimentally measured values.},

  abstract = {{The layer-by-layer (LbL) adsorption technique offers an easy and
	inexpensive process for multilayer formation and allows a variety
	of materials to be incorporated within the film structures. Therefore,
	the LbL assembly method can be regarded as a versatile bottom-up
	nanofabrication technique. Research fields concerned with LbL assembly
	have developed rapidly but some important physicochemical aspects
	remain uninvestigated. In this review, we will introduce several
	examples from physicochemical investigations regarding the basics
	of this method to advanced research aimed at practical applications.
	These are selected mostly from recent reports and should stimulate
	many physical chemists and chemical physicists in the further development
	of LbL assembly. In order to further understand the mechanism of
	the LbL assembly process, theoretical work, including thermodynamics
	calculations, has been conducted. Additionally, the use of molecular
	dynamics simulation has been proposed. Recently, many kinds of physicochemical
	molecular interactions, including hydrogen bonding, charge transfer
	interactions, and stereo-complex formation, have been used. The combination
	of the LbL method with other fabrication techniques such as spin-coating,
	spraying, and photolithography has also been extensively researched.
	These improvements have enabled preparation of LbL films composed
	of various materials contained in well-designed nanostructures. The
	resulting structures can be used to investigate basic physicochemical
	phenomena where relative distances between interacting groups is
	of great importance. Similarly, LbL structures prepared by such advanced
	techniques are used widely for development of functional systems
	for physical applications from photovoltaic devices and field effect
	transistors to biochemical applications including nano-sized reactors
	and drug delivery systems.}},

	we can analytically solve for several ground-state structures of
	the model, starting with states where all counterions are lined up
	in the gap between the rods, over planar configurations, where the
	counterions are divided up into a fraction which resides between
	the rods, and counterions which are located on the outer surfaces,
	up to configurations which cover the full rod surfaces. Using parallel
	tempering simulations, we are able to study the system over a wide
	range of temperatures. At low temperatures we find good agreement
	with our T = 0 results. At higher temperatures, the strong coupling
	(SC) theory delivers qualitatively better results. We furthermore
	demonstrate that for the SC theory and our ground-state approximations
	to yield quantitative agreement, three parameters are required to
	be large, the strong-coupling parameter \Xi , the Rouzina-Bloomfield
	parameter, and the ratio of the average distance of the counterions
	to the radius of the rods. In the case of the latter ratio being
	small, our T = 0 results show better agreement with the simulation

  abstract = {Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations provide microscopic pictures
	of the behavior of TBP (tri-n-butyl phosphate) at the water-"oil"
	interface, and in water-"oil" mixtures where "oil" is modeled by
	chloroform. It is shown that, depending on the TBP concentration
	and water acidity, TBP behaves as a surfactant, an interface modifier,
	or a solute in oil. At low concentrations, TBP is surface active
	and forms an unsaturated monolayer at the "planar" interface between
	the pure water and oil phases, adopting an "amphiphilic orientation".
	Increasing the TBP concentration induces water-oil mixing at the
	interface which becomes very rough while TBP orientations at the
	phase boundary are more random and TBP molecules solubilize in oil.
	The effect of water acidity is investigated with three nitric acid
	models: neutral NO3H, ionic NO3- H3O+ and TBPH+ NO3-. The role of
	these species on the properties of the water-oil boundaries and on
	the outcome of water-oil demixing experiments is presented. The neutral
	NO3H form is highly surface active. Hydrogen bonding between TBP
	and NO3H, TBPH+, or H3O+ disrupts the first TBP layer and leads,
	at high TBP concentrations, to a mixed third phase or to a microemulsion.
	These results are important for our understanding of the microscopic
	solution state of liquid-liquid extraction systems.},

	been demonstrated. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) measurements
	in mixtures of acetonitrile and water have shown that under nearly
	all sulfonation conditions tested here the mass distribution of the

  abstract = {The dielectric response of a simple model of a polar fluid near neutral
	interfaces is examined by a combination of linear response theory
	and extensive molecular dynamics simulations. Fluctuation expressions
	for a local permittivity tensor epsilon(r) are derived for planar
	and spherical geometries, based on the assumption of a purely local
	relationship between polarization and electric field. While the longitudinal
	component of epsilon exhibits strong oscillations on the molecular
	scale near interfaces, the transverse component becomes ill defined
	and unphysical, indicating nonlocality in the dielectric response.
	Both components go over to the correct bulk permittivity beyond a
	few molecular diameters. Upon approaching interfaces from the bulk,
	the permittivity tends to increase, rather than decrease as commonly
	assumed, and this behavior is confirmed for a simple model of water
	near a hydrophobic surface. An unexpected finding of the present
	analysis is the formation of "electrostatic double layers" signaled
	by a dramatic overscreening of an externally applied field inside
	the polar fluid close to an interface. The local electric field is
	of opposite sign to the external field and of significantly larger
	amplitude within the first layer of polar molecules.},

	to a neutralization of the system by two charged walls and can be
	viewed as the extension to the two-dimensional (2D)+h geometry of
	the neutralization by a homogeneous background in the standard three-dimensional
	Ewald method. The energies and forces can be computed efficiently
	by using advanced methods for systems with 2D periodicity, such as
	MMM2D or P3M-ELC, or by introducing a simple background-charge correction
	to the Yeh???Berkowitz approach of slab systems. The results are
	checked against direct lattice sum calculations on simple systems.
	We show, in particular, that the Madelung energy of a 2D square charge
	lattice in a uniform compensating background is correctly reproduced
	to high accuracy. A molecular dynamics simulation of a sodium ion
	close to an air-water interface is performed to demonstrate that
	the method does indeed provide consistent long-range electrostatics.
	The mean force on the ion reduces at large distances to the image-charge
	interaction predicted by macroscopic electrostatics. This result
	is used to determine precisely the position of the macroscopic dielectric
	interface with respect to the true molecular surface},

  abstract = {Surface formulations of biophysical modeling problems offer attractive
	theoretical and computational properties. Numerical simulations based
	on these formulations usually begin with discretization of the surface
	under consideration; often, the surface is curved, possessing complicated
	structure and possibly singularities. Numerical simulations commonly
	are based on approximate, rather than exact, discretizations of these
	surfaces. To assess the strength of the dependence of simulation
	accuracy on the fidelity of surface representation, here methods
	were developed to model several important surface formulations using
	exact surface discretizations. Following and refining Zauhar's work
	[J. Comput.-Aided Mol. Des. 9, 149 (1995)], two classes of curved
	elements were defined that can exactly discretize the van der Waals,
	solvent-accessible, and solvent-excluded (molecular) surfaces. Numerical
	integration techniques are presented that can accurately evaluate
	nonsingular and singular integrals over these curved surfaces. After
	validating the exactness of the surface discretizations and demonstrating
	the correctness of the presented integration methods, a set of calculations
	are presented that compare the accuracy of approximate, planar-triangle-based
	discretizations and exact, curved-element-based simulations of surface-generalized-Born
	(sGB), surface-continuum van der Waals (scvdW), and boundary-element
	method (BEM) electrostatics problems. Results demonstrate that continuum
	electrostatic calculations with BEM using curved elements, piecewise-constant
	basis functions, and centroid collocation are nearly ten times more
	accurate than planar-triangle BEM for basis sets of comparable size.
	The sGB and scvdW calculations give exceptional accuracy even for
	the coarsest obtainable discretized surfaces. The extra accuracy
	is attributed to the exact representation of the solute-solvent interface;
	in contrast, commonly used planar-triangle discretizations can only
	offer improved approximations with increasing discretization and
	associated increases in computational resources. The results clearly
	demonstrate that the methods for approximate integration on an exact
	geometry are far more accurate than exact integration on an approximate
	geometry. A MATLAB implementation of the presented integration methods
	and sample data files containing curved-element discretizations of
	several small molecules are available online as supplemental material},

	gels at swelling equilibrium. In the weak screening limit where the
	Debye-H{\"u}ckel screening length is larger than the mesh size of
	the gel, the direct electrostatic interactions are negligible and
	the swelling is driven by the osmotic pressure of the counterions.
	The tension created by this pressure is transmitted through the crosslinks
	to the elastic chains which behave as isolated chains with an applied
	force at their end points. The structure factor of the gel can be
	split into a frozen component due to the average concentration heterogeneities
	and a thermodynamic component due to concentration fluctuations.
	The frozen component has a peak at a wavevector of the order of the
	mesh size of the gel, the thermodynamic component has a peak at a
	higher wavevector of the order of the inverse transverse radius of
	the chains. At infinite times the dynamic structure factor relaxes
	towards the frozen component of the static structure factor. In the
	limit of small wavevectors the relaxation is diffusive with a diffusion
	constant equal to the Stokes diffusion constant of the Pincus blobs
	of the stretched chains. The diffusion constant shows a minimum at

	by capillary electrophoresis in HEC solutions can be achieved significantly
	below the entanglement threshold, depending on DNA size and HEC molecular

	The Kratky and the Sharp and Bloomfield approaches appear to yield

  abstract = {The very popular notion of effective or renormalized polyion charge
	is a concept of fundamental importance in the held of highly charged
	colloidal or polyelectrolyte solutions. In such suspensions, the
	electrostatic coupling between oppositely charged species induces
	a strong accumulation (or electrostatic {"}condensation{"}) of counterions
	in the vicinity of the macroion surface. The basic idea is thus to
	consider the structural colloid and the condensed counterionic shell
	as a whole which carries an effective charge, Z(eff), much weaker
	than the structural one, Z(str). Consequently, as long as what happens
	far from the colloid is concerned, all Debye-H{\"u}ckel-like linearized
	approaches which fail to correctly treat the nonlinear condensation
	phenomenon can still be used if Z(str) is more or less replaced by
	Z(eff). Beyond this basic idea, it remains to estimate a priori the
	value of Z(eff) It will be discussed how to deduce simple laws for
	the effective charge of spherical colloids from the Poisson-Boltzmann
	approach, analogous to Manning's law for linear polyelectrolytes.
	The validity of these laws will be tested, against more complete
	treatments. Lastly, it will be shown that while the notion of colloidal
	charge renormalization remains clear for dilute suspensions, it becomes
	incorrect at higher densities where the condensed counterionic shells
	overlap. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {A parallel message-passing implementation of a molecular dynamics
	(MD) program that is useful for bio(macro)molecules in aqueous environment
	is described. The software has been developed for a custom-designed
	32-processor ring GROMACS (GROningen MAchine for Chemical Simulation)
	with communication to and from left and right neighbours, but can
	run on any parallel system onto which a a ring of processors can
	be mapped and which supports PVM-like block send and receive calls.
	The GROMACS software consists of a preprocessor, a parallel MD and
	energy minimization program that can use an arbitrary number of processors
	(including one), an optional monitor, and several analysis tools.
	The programs are written in ANSI C and available by ftp (information:
	gromacs@chem.rug.nl). The functionality is based on the GROMOS (GROningen
	MOlecular Simulation) package (van Gunsteren and Berendsen, 1987;
	BIOMOS B.V., Nijenborgh 4, 9747 AG Groningen). Conversion programs
	between GROMOS and GROMACS formats are included. The MD program can
	handle rectangular periodic boundary conditions with temperature
	and pressure scaling. The interactions that can be handled without
	modification are variable non-bonded pair interactions with Coulomb
	and Lennard-Jones or Buckingham potentials, using a twin-range cut-off
	based on charge groups, and fixed bonded interactions of either harmonic
	or constraint type for bonds and bond angles and either periodic
	or cosine power series interactions for dihedral angles. Special
	forces can be added to groups of particles (for non-equilibrium dynamics
	or for position restraining) or between particles (for distance restraints).
	The parallelism is based on particle decomposition. Interprocessor
	communication is largely limited to position and force distribution
	over the ring once per time step.},

	precipitation). In a previous report [Langmuir 2004, 20, 27852791],
	we presented a model for the electrostatic free energy change when
	(weakly charged) polyelectrolyte forms a homogeneous complex phase.
	The influence of ionization of the polymer on the electrostatic free
	energy of the complex was incorporated but the influence of complex
	density neglected. In the present effort, cylindrical cells are assumed
	around each polyelectrolyte chain in the complex, and on the basis
	of the PoissonBoltzmann equation, the electrostatic free energy is
	calculated as a function of the complex density. After combination
	with FloryHuggins mixing free energy terms and minimization of the
	total free energy, the equilibrium complex density is obtained, for
	a given ratio of polycations to polyanions in the complex. The analysis
	is used in an example calculation of polyelectrolyte film formation
	by alternatingly applying a polycation and a polyanion solution.
	The calculation suggests that the often observed exponential growth
	of a polyelectrolyte film when the polymer is weakly charged has
	a thermodynamic origin: the polyelectrolyte complex shifts repeatedly
	between two equilibrium states of different densities and compositions.
	However, when the polyelectrolytes are strongly charged the difference
	in the compositions between the two equilibrium states is very small,
	and exponential growth by an absorption mechanism is no longer possible.

	polymer becomes more strongly charged and suggests that complexation
	of polyacid or polybase with zwitterionic polymer (e.g., protein)
	of the same charge sign (at the wrong side of the iso-electric point)
	may be due (in part) to an induced charge reversal of the protein.

  abstract = {The goal of this work is to explore the effects of solution ionic
	strength and pH on polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) assembly, using
	biologically derived polysaccharides as the polyelectrolytes. We
	used the layer-by-layer (LBL) technique to assemble PEM of the polysaccharides
	heparin (a strong polyanion) and chitosan (a weak polycation) and
	characterized the sensitivity of the PEM composition and layer thickness
	to changes in processing parameters. Fourier-transform surface plasmon
	resonance (FT-SPR) and spectroscopic ellipsometry provided in situ
	and ex situ measurements of the PEM thickness, respectively. Vibrational
	spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) provided
	details of the chemistry (i.e., composition, electrostatic interactions)
	of the PEM. We found that when PEM were assembled from 0.2 M buffer,
	the PEM thickness could be increased from less than 2 nm per bilayer
	to greater than 4 nm per bilayer by changing the solution pH; higher
	and lower ionic strength buffer solutions resulted in narrower ranges
	of accessible thickness. Molar composition of the PEM was not very
	sensitive to solution pH or ionic strength, but pH did affect the
	interactions between the sulfonates in heparin and amines in chitosan
	when PEM were assembled from 0.2 M buffer. Changes in the PEM thickness
	with pH and ionic strength can be interpreted through descriptions
	of the charge density and conformation of the polyelectrolyte chains
	in solution.},

	It is known that electrostatic, van der Waals, hydrophobic, and hydration

	but it is difficult to study their influence separately and to quantify
	their contributions. In the present study we investigate five different

	(fibrinogen) that adsorbs onto them. Atomic force microscopy (AFM)
	was employed to record force-distance curves with hydrophobic probes
	depending on the ion concentration, and the amount of the protein
	that adsorbs relative to a hydrophobic surface was quantified using
	ellipsometry. The findings suggest that electrostatic forces can
	create a very low energy barrier thus only slightly decreasing the
	number of negatively charged proteins in solution with sufficient
	energy to approach the surface closely, and have a rather small influence
	on the amount that adsorbs. The films we investigated were not protein
	resistant. This supports other studies, reporting that a strong short-range
	repulsion as for example caused by hydration forces is required to
	make these films resistant to the non-specific adsorption of proteins.},

	in the bulk of the solution has either a spherical conformation or
	a necklace structure. At sufficiently high surface charge density,
	a chain in the globular conformation adsorbs in a flat pancake conformation
	due to the Coulombic attraction to the oppositely charged surface.
	Different adsorption regimes are predicted depending on two screening
	lengths (the Debye screening length monitored by the salt concentration
	and the Gouy-Chapman length monitored by the surface charge density),
	on the degree of ionization of the polymer and on the solvent strength.
	At low bulk ionic strength, an increase in the surface charge density
	may induce a transition from an adsorbed necklace structure to a
	uniform pancake due to the enhanced screening of the intra-chain
	Coulombic repulsion by the counterions localized near the surface.},

	and rezip a double-stranded coiled-coil structure at varying pulling
	velocities. We find that force-extension traces exhibit hysteresis
	that grows with increasing pulling velocity. This shows that coiled-coil
	unzipping and rezipping do not occur in thermal equilibrium on our
	experimental time scale. We present a nonequilibrium simulation that
	fully reproduces the hysteresis effects, giving detailed insight
	into dynamics of coiled-coil folding. Using this model, we find that
	seed formation is responsible for the hysteresis. The seed consists
	of four -helical turns on both strands of the coiled coil. To obtain
	equilibrium information from our nonequilibrium experiments, we used
	the Crooks fluctuation theorem (CFT) to calculate the equilibrium
	free energy of folding for all of the different pulling velocities.
	The paper presented here lays the groundwork for the study of self-assembly
	properties of many physiologically relevant coiled-coil structures
	at the single-molecule level.},

	This model provides insight into biological processes such as DNA

	to an effective interlinker interaction that is repulsive at large

	main findings are confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations of
	two semiflexible charged chains in a mixture of monovalent and polyvalent

	distributions along the polyelectrolyte chains are considered: (i)
	smeared, where the charges are uniformly distributed along the chain.
	(ii) Annealed, where the charges are allowed to associate and dissociate
	from the chain. (iii) Permuted, where the total number of charges
	on the chain is fixed, but the charges can move along the chain.
	(iv) Quenched, where the charges on the chains are ``frozen'' in
	a random configuration. Finally, we also consider (v) polyampholytes,
	where each monomer can be positively or negatively charged, or neutral.
	Path integral formulation was used to derive mean field free energies
	for the different models. Self-consistent field equation is obtained
	for the polymer order parameter and a Poisson-Boltzmann like equation
	for the electrostatic potential. We show that the difference between
	the permuted and the smeared models is a constant shift in the chemical
	potential leading to similar mean field equations. Within mean-field
	the quenched model is found to be equivalent to the annealed one,
	provided that the system is coupled to a reservoir of polyelectrolyte
	chains. The random phase approximation is used to calculate the monomer-monomer
	structure factor S(q) for the different statistical charge distribution
	models. We show that in the annealed model fluctuations of the monomer
	charges contribute to the electrostatic screening in addition to
	the free ions in the solution. The strength of this screening depends
	on the variance of the monomer charge distribution and is especially
	important for polyampholytes in bad solvent conditions where the
	mesophase separation is enhanced. The ratio between the variance
	and the net average charge determines whether polyampholytes behave
	more as polyelectrolytes or as neutral chains.},

	analysis to the stretching of a few grafted chains ({"}mushroom{"}
	regime) when a shear flow (rate s) of the solvent is imposed near
	the wall. Here the elongation L approximately N3/2 s1/2 and the blob
	size decreases as y approximately x -1/2 . 3. Finally we discuss
	a chain confined in a slit. We find L approximately N4/3V1/3 and
	blobs sizes y approximately x-3/4. In all these cases, the deformation
	is progressive and we expect no sharp coil stretch transitions.},

  abstract = {Over the last 15 years, the layer-by-layer deposition of polyelectrolytes
	and the growth of polymer brushes from surfaces have become established
	techniques for the formation of a wide range of thin films. This
	article discusses the use of these techniques in creating the skin
	layer of nanofiltration or gas-separation membranes and in functionalizing
	the interior of membranes for protein adsorption or catalysis. In
	the case of separation membranes for nanofiltration, the minimal
	thickness of layer-by-layer films allows for high flux, and the wide
	range of available polyelectrolytes that can form these films permits
	the tailoring of membranes for separations such as water softening,
	the reduction of F (-) concentrations, and the removal of dyes from
	wastewater. For gas separation, polymers grown from surfaces are
	more attractive than layer-by-layer coatings because most polyelectrolyte
	films are not highly gas-selective. Cross-linked poly(ethylene glycol
	dimethacrylate) films grown from porous alumina exhibit CO(2)/CH(4)
	selectivities of around 20, and the careful selection of monomers
	should further improve the selectivity of similar membranes. Both
	layer-by-layer methods and polymer brushes can also be employed to
	modify the interior of membranes, and we have utilized these techniques
	to create catalysts, antibody arrays in membranes, and membrane absorbers
	for protein purification. Polymer brushes are particularly attractive
	because they allow the absorption of multilayers of protein to yield
	membranes with binding capacities as high as 150 mg protein/cm(3).
	Some challenges in the practical implementation of these systems,
	such as the economical formation of membranes using highly permeable
	polymeric supports, and future directions in research on membrane
	modification with multilayer films and polymer brushes are also discussed
	herein.},

	within the ten first deposited layers. Results show a change of growth
	regime between an early stage where the substrate had a dominating
	influence in the build-up and a second stage where the polymer uptake
	was ruled essentially by polymer-polymer interactions. The pH was
	seen to influence the growth via the charge densities of silica (first
	stage) and PAA (first and second stages). The increase of NaCl concentration
	induced an increase of the film weight between 10-3 and 10-2 M, but
	the trend was more sophisticated between 10-2 and 10-1 M where the
	polymer uptake increased in the first stage of the growth and decreased
	in subsequent layers. The film weight increased in accordance with
	the rank of ions in the Hofmeister series. AFM images revealed a
	heterogeneous film morphology with bumps and valleys, which was explained
	by a growth mechanism made of the successive formation and growth
	of polymer complexes.},

	neutrality more efficiently in the confined space of the filter.
	The applicability of this mechanism has been confirmed earlier in

	ionic liquids are reported. Triazolium cations include 1,2,4-triazolium,
	1,2,3-triazolium, 4-amino-1,2,4-triazolium, and 1-methyl-4-amino-1,2,4-triazolium.
	Each cation was paired with a nitrate or perchlorate anion. These
	materials are part of a class of ionic compounds that have been synthesized
	recently but for which little physical property data are available.
	Properties of the more common ionic liquid, 1-n-butyl-3-methylimidazolium
	nitrate, are also computed and compared with the properties of the
	triazolium-based compounds. A molecular mechanics force field was
	developed for these materials using a mix of ab initio calculations
	and parameter fitting using the molecular compound 1H-1,2,4-triazole
	as a basis for the triazolium cations. Liquid-phase properties that
	were computed include heat capacities, cohesive energy densities,
	gravimetric densities/molar volumes as a function of temperature
	and pressure, self-diffusivities, rotational time constants, and
	various pair correlation functions. In the solid phase, heat capacities
	and lattice parameters were computed. Of all of these properties,
	only lattice parameters have been measured experimentally (and only
	for four of the triazolium compounds). The agreement with the experimental
	crystal structures was good. When compared with that of the imidazolium-based
	ionic liquid, the triazolium-based materials have much smaller molar
	volumes, higher cohesive energy densities, and larger specific heat
	capacities. They also tend to be less compressible, have a higher
	gravimetric density, and have faster rotational dynamics but similar
	translational dynamics.},

	of charged Lennard-Jones particles with explicit counterions. We
	have studied the effects of the surface charge density, surface charge
	distribution, solvent quality for the polymer backbone, strength
	of the short-range interactions between polymers and substrates on
	the polymer surface coverage, and the thickness of the adsorbed layer.
	The polymer surface coverage monotonically increases with increasing
	surface charge density for almost all studied systems except for
	the system of hydrophilic polyelectrolytes adsorbing at hydrophilic
	surfaces. In this case the polymer surface coverage saturates at
	high surface charge densities. This is due to additional monomermonomer
	repulsion between adsorbed polymer chains, which becomes important
	in dense polymeric layers. These interactions also preclude surface
	overcharging by hydrophilic polyelectrolytes at high surface charge
	densities. The thickness of the adsorbed layer shows monotonic dependence
	on the surface charge density for the systems of hydrophobic polyelectrolytes
	for both hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces. Thickness is a decreasing
	function of the surface charge density in the case of hydrophilic
	surfaces while it increases with the surface charge density for hydrophobic
	substrates. Qualitatively different behavior is observed for the
	thickness of the adsorbed layer of hydrophilic polyelectrolytes at
	hydrophilic surfaces. In this case, thickness first decreases with
	increasing surface charge density, then it begins to increase. },

	the cavity pressure P to follow a scale relationship with the monomer

	alpha=2.15+-0.05, whereas MC simulations lead to alpha=2.73+- 0.04.
	The underestimation of alpha by the SCF method is explained in terms

	field calculations to extend the popular Smooth Particle Mesh Ewald
	(SPME) algorithm as the Staggered Mesh Ewald (StME) algorithm. StME
	improves the accuracy of computed forces by up to 1.2 orders of magnitude
	and also reduces the drift in system momentum inherent in the SPME
	method by averaging the results of two separate reciprocal space
	calculations. StME can use charge mesh spacings roughly 1.5 x larger
	than SPME to obtain comparable levels of accuracy; the one mesh in
	an SPME calculation can therefore be replaced with two separate meshes,
	each less than one-third of the original size. Coarsening the charge
	mesh can be balanced with reductions in the direct space cutoff to
	optimize performance: the efficiency of StME rivals or exceeds that
	of SPME calculations with similarly optimized parameters. StME may
	also offer advantages for parallel molecular dynamics simulations
	because it permits the use of coarser meshes without requiring higher
	orders of charge interpolation and also because the two reciprocal
	space calculations can be run independently if that is most suitable
	for the machine architecture. We are planning other improvements
	to the standard SPME algorithm and anticipate that StME will work
	synergistically will all of them to dramatically improve the efficiency
	and parallel scaling of molecular simulations.},

  abstract = {A theory for the frequency dependence of ionic conductivity of an
	electrolyte solution is presented. In this theory contributions to
	the conductivity from both the ion atmosphere relaxation and the
	electrophoretic effects are included in a self-consistent fashion.
	Mode coupling theory, combined with time-dependent density functional
	theory of ion atmosphere fluctuations, leads to expressions for these
	two contributions at finite frequencies. These expressions need to
	be solved self-consistently for the frequency dependence of the electrolyte
	friction and the ion conductivity at varying ion concentrations.
	In the limit of low concentration, the present theory reduces exactly
	to the well-known Debye-Falkenhagen (DF) expression of the frequency-dependent
	electrolyte friction when the non-Markovian effects in the ion atmosphere
	relaxation are ignored and in addition the ions are considered to
	be pointlike. The present theory also reproduces the expressions
	of the frequency-dependent conductivity derived by Chandra, Wei,
	and Patey when appropriate limiting situations are considered. We
	have carried out detailed numerical solutions of the self-consistent
	equations for concentrated solutions of a 1:1 electrolyte by using
	the expressions of pair correlation functions given by Attard. Numerical
	results reveal that the frequency dependence of the electrolyte friction
	at finite concentration can be quite different from that given by
	the DF expression. With the increase of ion concentration, the dispersion
	of the friction is found to occur at a higher frequency because of
	faster relaxation of the ion atmosphere. At low frequency, the real
	part of the conductivity shows a small increase with frequency which
	can be attributed to the well-known Debye-Falkenhagen effect. At
	high frequency, the conductivity decreases as expected. The extensions
	of the present theory to treat frequency-dependent diffusivities
	of charged colloid suspensions and conductivity of a dilute polyelectrolyte
	solution are discussed. (C) 2000 American Institute of Physics. [S0021-9606(00)51103-9].},

	with implicit solvent are not clearly seen in snapshots of chain
	conformations, although there is a clustering of monomers. An analysis
	of the single chain structure factor using a Kratky plot is misleading
	and not consistent with an analysis of cluster formation or a visual
	examination of snapshots. The conformational dynamics, as manifested
	in the decay of the intermediate scattering function, is relatively
	insensitive to solvent quality, except for the poorest solvent conditions.
	In this case the single chain structure factor displays oscillations,
	and the intermediate scattering function displays a dynamic slowing
	down at corresponding wavevectors. The simulations suggest that the
	presence of explicit solvent molecules can be an important aspect
	of polyelectrolyte behavior in poor solvents. },

  abstract = {A computer simulation model is introduced to study the characteristics
	of isolated conductors in electrostatic equilibrium. Drawing an analogy
	between electrons and how they move to the surface of isolated conductors,
	we randomly initialize a large number of particles inside a small
	region at the center of simulated conductors and advance them according
	to their forces of repulsion. By use of optimized numerical techniques
	of the finite-size particle method associated with Poisson's equation,
	the particles are quickly advanced using a fast Fourier transform
	and their charge is efficiently shared using the clouds-in-cells
	method. The particle populations in the simulations range from 50x103
	to 1x106 that move in various computation domains equal to 128x128,
	256x256, and 512x512 grids. When the particles come to an electrostatic
	equilibrium, they lie on the boundaries of the simulated conductors,
	from which the equilibrium properties are obtained. Consistent with
	the theory of electrostatics and charged conductors, we found that
	the particles move in response to the conductor geometry in such
	a way that the electrostatic energy is minimized. Good approximation
	results for the equilibrium properties were obtained using the proposed
	computer simulation model.},

	devices. The review has been organized into three separate sections:
	defining the basis of smart properties in polymeric gels; describing
	representative stimuli to which these gels respond; and illustrating
	a sample application area, namely, microfluidics. One of the major
	limitations in the use of hydrogels in stimuli-responsive applications
	is the diffusion rate-limited transduction of signals. This can be
	obviated by engineering interconnected pores in the polymer structure
	to form capillary networks in the matrix and by downscaling the size
	of hydrogels to significantly decrease diffusion paths. Reducing
	the lag time in the induction of smart responses can be highly useful
	in biomedical devices, such as sensors and actuators. This review
	also describes molecular imprinting techniques to fabricate hydrogels
	for specific molecular recognition of target analytes. Additionally,
	it describes the significant advances in bottom-up nanofabrication
	strategies, involving supramolecular chemistry. Learning to assemble
	supramolecular structures from nature has led to the rapid prototyping
	of functional supramolecular devices. In essence, the barriers in
	the current performance potential of biomedical devices can be lowered

  abstract = {Using computer simulations, the electrophoretic motion of a positively
	charged colloid (macroion) in an electrolyte solution is studied
	in the framework of the primitive model. In this model, the electrolyte
	is considered as a system of negatively and positively charged microions
	(counterions and coions, respectively) that are immersed into a structureless
	medium. Hydrodynamic interactions are fully taken into account by
	applying a hybrid simulation scheme, where the charged ions (i.e.,
	macroion and electrolyte), propagated via molecular dynamics, are
	coupled to a lattice Boltzmann (LB) fluid. In a recent electrophoretic
	experiment by Martin-Molina et al. [J. Phys. Chem. B 106, 6881 (2002)],
	it was shown that, for multivalent salt ions, the mobility \mu initially
	increases with charge density , reaches a maximum, and then decreases
	with further increase of . The aim of the present work is to elucidate
	the behavior of \mu at high values of . Even for the case of monovalent
	microions, a decrease of \mu with is found. A dynamic Stern layer
	is defined that includes all the counterions that move with the macroion
	while subjected to an external electrical field. The number of counterions
	in the Stern layer, q0, is a crucial parameter for the behavior of
	\mu at high values of . In this case, the mobility \mu depends primarily
	on the ratio q0/Q (with Q the valency of the macroion). The previous
	contention that the increase in the distortion of the electric double
	layer (EDL) with increasing leads to the lowering of \mu does not
	hold for high . In fact, it is shown that the deformation of the
	EDL decreases with the increase of . The role of hydrodynamic interactions
	is inferred from direct comparisons to Langevin simulations where
	the coupling to the LB fluid is switched off. Moreover, systems with
	divalent counterions are considered. In this case, at high values

	adsorbed layer, amount of adsorbed polymer, and the overcharging

	radius of gyration so that the chain can completely wrap around it.
	The formation of a polyelectrolyte/particle complex and the conformations

	decreasing the ionic strength, electrostatic repulsions between the

	in solution, hence decreasing the amount of polyelectrolyte adsorption.
	By decreasing the particle size still further, the low ionic concentration
	regime is dominated by monomer-monomer repulsions; the polymer partially
	wraps around or becomes tangential to the particle and two tails
	extend in opposite directions. The complex may or may not exhibit
	charge inversion depending on the particle size and ionic concentration.
	We find that charge reversal increases with salt concentration and

	properties such as the radius of gyration, and single chain structure

	interactions, ionic concentration, and monomer number. It is observed
	that hydrophobic polyelectrolytes exhibit a large variety of conformations
	compared to flexible or semiflexible polyelectrolytes without hydrophobic
	groups. MC results demonstrate that there is a range of electrolyte
	concentration and hydrophobicity for which polymers exhibit exotic
	but stable conformations, namely the pearl necklace and the cigar-shape
	conformation. It is shown that by gradually increasing the monomer
	hydrophobicity of a strong polyelectrolyte, it undergoes a cascade
	of transitions from an extended structure to a pearl necklace, a
	pearl necklace to a cylinder, and a cylinder to a coil, successively.
	Smooth transitions are observed when competition between hydrophillic
	and hydrophobic interactions is important, whereas sharp transitions
	are obtained in the other cases. A good agreement is observed with
	the theoretical description of weakly charged polyelectrolytes in
	poor solvent conditions. To have an insight of the spatial organization

	coefficients of ions and water molecules and also the orientational
	relaxation times. The pair dynamics is studied by evaluating the

	water molecules are also investigated at varying ion concentration.
	Finally, we explore the collective dynamical properties by calculating
	the frequency dependent dielectric function and conductivity. It
	is found that the self and relative diffusion coeffcients decrease
	and the orientational relaxation times increase with ion concentration.
	The residence times of water molecules near ions and also the structural
	relaxation time of water-water hydrogen bonds show an increasing
	trend as the ion concentration is increased. The dielectric relaxation
	time is found to decrease with ion concentration for the solutions

	shows significant departure from the Nernst-Einstein behavior due
	to formation of ion pairs. With an increase of frequency, the conductivity
	first increases substantially and then decreases at very high frequency.
	The initial increase of conductivity is attributed to the disruption
	of ion pairs on application of high frequency electric fields. (C)

	using the electrospinning technique. Methylene blue (MB) was used
	as a model drug to evaluate the potential application of the fibers
	for drug delivery. The release of MB was controlled in a nonbuffered
	medium by changing the pH of the solution. The sustained release
	of MB in a phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution was achieved
	by constructing perfluorosilane networks on the fiber surfaces as
	capping layers. Temperature controlled release of MB was obtained
	by depositing temperature sensitive PAA/poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)
	(PNIPAAM) multilayers onto the fiber surfaces. The controlled release

	In the simulations we use a coarse-grained charged bead-spring model
	in a dielectric continuum, with explicit counterions and full electrostatic
	interactions under periodic and nonperiodic boundary conditions.
	The Poisson-Boltzmann hydrogel model is that of a single charged
	colloid confined to a spherical cell where the counterions are allowed
	to enter the uniformly charged sphere. In order to investigate the
	origin of the differences these two models may give, we performed
	a variety of simulations of different hydrogel models which were
	designed to test for the influence of charge correlations, excluded
	volume interactions, arrangement of charges along the polymer chains,
	and thermal fluctuations in the chains of the gel. These intermediate
	models systematically allow us to connect the Poisson-Boltzmann cell
	model to the bead-spring model hydrogel model in a stepwise manner
	thereby testing various approximations. Overall, the simulational
	results of all these hydrogel models are in good agreement, especially
	for the number of confined counterions within the gel. Our results
	support the applicability of the Poisson-Boltzmann cell model to
	study ionic properties of hydrogels under dilute conditions.},

  abstract = {We present a model for the efficient simulation of generic bilayer
	membranes. Individual lipids are represented by one head bead and
	two tail beads. By means of simple pair potentials these robustly
	self-assemble to a fluid bilayer state over a wide range of parameters,
	without the need for an explicit solvent. The model shows the expected
	elastic behavior on large length scales, and its physical properties
	(e.g., fluidity or bending stiffness) can be widely tuned via a single
	parameter. In particular, bending rigidities in the experimentally
	relevant range are obtained, at least within 3\x{2013}30k_B T. The
	model is naturally suited to study many physical topics, including
	self-assembly, fusion, bilayer melting, lipid mixtures, rafts, and
	protein-bilayer interactions.},

	to the Weiner et al. force field and was developed with some of the
	same philosophies, such as the use of a simple diagonal potential
	function and electrostatic potential fit atom centered charges. The
	need for a 10-12 function for representing hydrogen bonds is no longer
	necessary due to the improved performance of the new charge model
	and new van der Waals parameters. These new charges are determined
	using a 6-31G* basis set and restrained electrostatic potential (RESP)
	fitting and have been shown to reproduce interaction energies, free
	energies of solvation, and conformational energies of simple small
	molecules to a good degree of accuracy. Furthermore, the new RESP
	charges exhibit less variability as a function of the molecular conformation
	used in the charge determination. The new van der Waals parameters
	have been derived from liquid simulations and include hydrogen parameters
	which take into account the effects of any geminal electronegative
	atoms. The bonded parameters developed by Weiner et al. were modified
	as necessary to reproduce experimental vibrational frequencies and
	structures. Most of the simple dihedral parameters have been retained
	from Weiner et al., but a complex set of $\phi$ and $\psi$ parameters
	which do a good job of reproducing the energies of the low-energy
	conformations of glycyl and alanyl dipeptides has been developed
	for the peptide backbone.},

	the accuracy of the Poisson-Boltzmann and Poisson-Nernst-Planck theories,
	when applied to channel-like environments, by including a specific
	dielectric self-energy term to overcome spurious shielding effects
	inherent in these theories. By comparing results with Brownian dynamics
	simulations, we show that the inclusion of an additional term in
	the equations yields significant qualitative improvements. The modified
	theories perform well in very wide and very narrow channels, but
	are less successful at intermediate sizes. The situation is worse
	in multi-ion channels because of the inability of the continuum theories
	to handle the ion-to-ion interactions correctly. Thus, further work
	is required if these continuum theories are to be reliably salvaged
	for quantitative studies of biological ion channels in all situations.},

  abstract = {According to Stokes' treatment, the ionic mobility of particles, which
	are small with respect to Debye length, is usually considered to
	be proportional to the nominal charge and inversely proportional
	to the hydrodynamic radius. Experimentally, it is well known, however,
	that the ionic mobility of a small multicharged molecule does not
	depend linearly on its nominal charge in a wide range. This behavior
	can be accounted for by a condensation of the charge or a modification
	of the friction coefficient with the charge. This paper presents
	a semiempirical modeling of the actual mobility based on the assumption
	of additivity of frictional contributions pertaining to the uncharged
	molecular backbone and to each charged or uncharged moiety. Condensation
	of the charge was not considered. The model first appeared to be
	suitable for multicharged analytes having a characteristic dimension
	smaller than the Debye length, such as benzene polycarboxylic acids
	and polysulfated disaccharides. This approach was then adapted to
	account for the actual mobilities of singly and evenly charged oligomers
	(N-mers) having a dimension smaller than or similar to the Debye
	length. Rather good experimental agreement was obtained for polyalanines
	and polyglycines (N < or = 6), fatty acid homologs, fully sulfonated
	polystyrene oligomers (N < or = 13), and polycytidines (N < or =
	10). Especially the influence of the polymerization degree on the
	mobility of oligomers having identical charge densities was clarified.
	It is also shown that the electrophoretic contribution to the overall
	friction coefficient increases linearly with the nominal charge but
	hardly depends on the chemical nature of the charged moieties. This
	model should be of interest to evaluate the role of various physicochemical
	phenomena (hydrodynamic and electrophoretic frictions, hydrodynamic
	coupling, charge condensation) involved in the migration of charged
	oligomers.},

	Up to 20 GHz the dielectric response is bimodal. The longest relaxation

	dynamics and correlates with the viscosity in a manner consistent
	with hydrodynamic predictions for the diffusive reorientation of

	correlation. The time constants of the weak second process at the
	20 ps time scale are practically the same for each salt. This intermediate
	process seems to correlate with similar modes in optical Kerr effect
	spectra, but its physical origin is unclear. The missing high-frequency
	portion of the spectra indicates relaxation beyond the upper cutoff
	frequency of 20 GHz, presumably due to subpicosecond translational
	and librational displacements of ions in the cage of their counterions.

	was performed using a layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly technique within
	a nylon-based microfiltration (MF) membrane. In the second approach,
	a hydrophobic polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) MF membrane was functionalized
	by the in situ polymerization of acrylic acid. The enzyme, glucose
	oxidase (GOX), was then electrostatically immobilized inside the
	functionalized membrane domains to study the catalytic oxidation
	of glucose to gluconic acid and H2O2. Characterization of the functionalized
	membranes, in terms of polyelectrolyte/polymer domains and permeate
	flux, was also conducted. The kinetics of H2O2 formation was discussed,
	along with the effects of residence time and pH on the activity of

	two important concepts in the theoretical description of charged
	macromolecules. In this brief contribution we provide an introduction
	to both ideas and summarize a few important results which can be
	obtained from them. Our article is organized as follows: Section
	1 outlines the sequence of approximations which ultimately lead to
	the cell-model. Section 2 is devoted to two exact results, namely,
	an expression for the osmotic pressure and a formula for the ion
	density at the surface of the macromolecule, known as the contact
	value theorem. Section 3 provides a derivation of the Poisson-Boltzmann
	equation from a variational principle and the assumption of a product
	state. Section 4 applies Poisson-Boltzmann theory to the cell-model
	of linear polyelectrolytes. In particular, the behavior of the exact
	solution in the limit of zero density is compared to the concept
	of Manning condensation. Finally, Section 5 shows how a system described
	by a cell model can be coupled to a salt reservoir, i.e., how the
	so-called Donnan equilibrium is established. Our main motivation
	is to compile in a concise form a few of the basic concepts which
	form the arena for more advanced theories, treated in other lectures
	of this volume. Many of the basic concepts are discussed at greater
	length in a review article by Katchalsky (1971), which we warmly

	and linear Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) theory. From the volume derivative
	of the grand potential functional of linear theory we obtain two
	expressions for the osmotic pressure in terms of the potential or
	ion profiles, neither of which coincides with the expression known
	from nonlinear PB theory, namely, the density of microions at the
	cell boundary. We show that the range of validity of linearization
	depends strongly on the linearization point and prove that expansion
	about the self-consistently determined average potential is optimal
	in several respects. For instance, screening inside the suspension
	is automatically described by the actual ionic strength, resulting
	in the correct asymptotics at high colloid concentration. Together
	with the analytical solution of the linear PB equation for cell models
	of arbitrary dimension and electrolyte composition, explicit and
	very general formulas for the osmotic pressure ensue. A comparison
	with nonlinear PB theory is provided. Our analysis also shows that
	whether or not linear theory predicts a phase separation depends

	can be efficiently speeded up by the use of the Fast Fourier Transformation

	Additionally, we offer detailed accuracy measurements, which shed
	some light on the influence of several tuning parameters and also
	show that the existing methods -- although similar in spirit -- exhibit

	using a simple model employing Monte Carlo simulations. The polyion
	was represented by a sequence of negatively charged hard spheres
	connected with harmonic bonds. The charged surface groups were also
	represented by charged hard spheres, and they were positioned on
	a hard surface slightly protruding into the solution. The surface
	charges were either frozen in a liquidlike structure or laterally
	mobile. With a large excess of positive surface charges, the classical
	picture of a strongly adsorbed polyion with an extended and flat
	configuration emerged. However, adsorption also appeared at a net
	neutral surface or at a weakly negatively charged surface, and at
	these conditions the adsorption was stronger with a flexible polyion
	as compared to a semiflexible one, two features not appearing in
	simpler models containing homogeneously charged surfaces. The presence
	of charged surface patches (frozen surface charges) and the ability
	of polarization of the surface charges (mobile surface charges) are
	the main reasons for the enhanced adsorption. The stronger adsorption

  abstract = {A convergent second-order Cartesian grid finite difference scheme
	for the solution of Maxwell's equations is presented. The scheme
	employs a staggered grid in space and represents the physical location
	of the material and metallic boundaries correctly, hence eliminating
	problems caused by staircasing, and, contrary to the popular Yee
	scheme, enforces the correct jump-conditions on the field components
	across material interfaces. A detailed analysis of the accuracy of
	the new embedding scheme is presented, confirming its second-order
	global accuracy. Furthermore, the scheme is proven to be a bounded
	error scheme and thus convergent. Conditions for fully discrete stability
	is furthermore established. This enables the derivation of bounds
	for fully discrete stability with CFL-restrictions being almost identical
	to those of the much simpler Yee scheme. The analysis exposes that
	the effects of staircasing as well as a lack of properly enforced
	jump-conditions on the field components have significant consequences
	for the global accuracy. It is, among other things, shown that for
	cases in which a field component is discontinuous along a grid line,
	as happens at general two- and three-dimensional material interfaces,
	the Yee scheme may exhibit local divergence and loss of global convergence.
	To validate the analysis several one- and two-dimensional test cases
	are presented, showing an improvement of typically 1 to 2 orders
	of accuracy at little or no additional computational cost over the
	Yee scheme, which in most cases exhibits first order accuracy.},

  abstract = { We have studied the effect of short-range interactions on polyelectrolyte
	adsorption at oppositely and similarly charged surfaces. The properties
	of the adsorbed layer, such as polymer surface coverage, layer thickness,
	and surface overcharging (for adsorption at oppositely charged surfaces),
	are calculated as a function of the surface charge density, the strength
	of the short-range interactions, and the ionic strength of the solution.
	The properties of dilute and semidilute two-dimensional adsorbed
	layers are calculated in the framework of the strongly correlated
	Wigner liquid model. In these regimes, the surface overcharging by
	adsorbed polyelectrolyte chains increases as a function of the square
	root of the salt concentration. At higher surface charge densities,
	when adsorbed polyelectrolytes form a three-dimensional adsorbed
	layer, we use the self-consistent mean-field theory to calculate
	the layer properties. Here, the polymer surface coverage shows nonmonotonic
	dependence on the salt concentration; it initially increases as the
	salt concentration increases at low ionic strengths and then decreases
	as the ionic strength becomes higher than some critical value. The
	decrease of the surface coverage at a higher salt concentration is
	due to additional screening of the surface charge by salt ions. We
	show that the adsorption of polyelectrolytes at similarly charged
	surfaces can only occur within the range of surface charge densities
	where the short-range interactions dominate the electrostatic repulsion
	between adsorbed chains and the charged surface. In these regimes,
	the salt dependence of the polymer surface coverage and layer thickness
	is similar to that for polyelectrolyte adsorption at oppositely charged
	surfaces that are dominated by short-range interactions. },

  title = {Towards multiscale modeling of ionic liquids: From electronic structure
	to bulk properties},
  journal = {Journal of Molecular Liquids},
  year = {2010},
  volume = {152},
  pages = {2--8},
  abstract = {In this paper a multiscale approach for the description of ionic liquids
	and first results according to this scheme are presented. The basic
	idea is to combine post-Hartree-Fock calculations (pHF), density
	functional theory (DFT) and classical all-atomistic molecular dynamics
	simulations to go from individual molecules to bulk properties in
	a setup that is able to bridge the large time and length scale gaps
	involved. The idea is initially applied to a very simple, but well
	studied ionic liquid compound, namely dimethylimidazolium chloride.
	Results obtained on the post-Hartree-Fock level for one ion pair
	are compared to Car-Parrinello density functional results. Subsequently
	density functional results for several ion pairs up to 30 ion pairs
	are determined, that are intended to approach bulk features. The
	DFT results are finally compared to molecular dynamics simulations.
	A crucial step in this multiscale scheme is the analysis of the electrostatic
	potentials. The Bl{\"o}chl approach employed herein on the DFT level
	allows us to obtain values for partial charges, that are considerably
	different from the ones used in the standard force fields. The results
	suggest that the total charge of the cation and the anion should
	be scaled down to a value of around +/-0.6e to +/-0.8e. The usage
	of these partial charges within a standard force field yields structural
	and dynamical results that approach the structural results of the
	density functional calculations. Although this appears promising,
	another refinement step of the force field parameters will be necessary,
	as the density of mass obtained deviates by 15% from the experimental
	results. Possible further refinements of the force fields are discussed.},

	examined. The effect of including condensed counterions is analyzed.
	Comparison with other theories is made. Results of experiments of
	hydrophilic polyelectrolytes with monovalent counterions in salt-free
	solution have shown that the structure factor peak position and height
	can become invariant at high charge fraction. We show that this invariance
	may be the result of polymer-polymer correlations rather than the
	conventional explanation involving counterion condensation. On the
	other hand, as determined by the osmotic pressure, it is found that
	the solution can become mechanically unstable to macrophase separation
	at high charge fraction. In this case, adding explicit condensed
	counterions acts to stabilize the liquid, that is, intrachain correlations
	between condensed counterions, not contained in the idealized Manning-Oosawa
	theory, must be included.},

	applied extensively to study the dynamics of proteins and nucleic
	acids. Here we report the development of a third-generation point-charge
	all-atom force field for proteins. Following the earlier approach
	of Cornell et al., the charge set was obtained by fitting to the
	electrostatic potentials of dipeptides calculated using B3LYP/cc-pVTZ//HF/6-31G**
	quantum mechanical methods. The main-chain torsion parameters were
	obtained by fitting to the energy profiles of Ace-Ala-Nme and Ace-Gly-Nme
	di-peptides calculated using MP2/cc-pVTZ//HF/6-31G** quantum mechanical
	methods. All other parameters were taken from the existing AMBER
	data base. The major departure from previous force fields is that
	all quantum mechanical calculations were done in the condensed phase
	with continuum solvent models and an effective dielectric constant
	of {$\epsilon$} = 4. We anticipate that this force field parameter
	set will address certain critical short comings of previous force
	fields in condensed-phase simulations of proteins. Initial tests
	on peptides demonstrated a high-degree of similarity between the
	calculated and the statistically measured Ramanchandran maps for
	both Ace-Gly-Nme and Ace-Ala-Nme di-peptides. Some highlights of
	our results include (1) well-preserved balance between the extended
	and helical region distributions, and (2) favorable type-II poly-proline
	helical region in agreement with recent experiments. Backward compatibility
	between the new and Cornell et al. charge sets, as judged by overall
	agreement between dipole moments, allows a smooth transition to the
	new force field in the area of ligand-binding calculations. Test
	simulations on a large set of proteins are also discussed. 2003 Wiley

	by protonating the weak acid, thus decreasing polymer/polymer interactions,
	lead to incomplete loss of polymer, probably due to additional hydrogen

  abstract = {The translocation dynamics of a polymer chain through a nanopore in
	the absence of an external driving force is analyzed by means of
	scaling arguments, fractional calculus, and computer simulations.
	The problem at hand is mapped on a one dimensional {\em anomalous}
	diffusion process in terms of reaction coordinate $s$ (i.e. the translocated
	number of segments at time $t$) and shown to be governed by an universal
	exponent $\alpha = 2/(2\nu+2-\gamma_1)$ whose value is nearly the
	same in two- and three-dimensions. The process is described by a
	{\em fractional} diffusion equation which is solved exactly in the
	interval $0 <s < N$ with appropriate boundary and initial conditions.
	The solution gives the probability distribution of translocation
	times as well as the variation with time of the statistical moments:
	$<s(t)>$, and $<s^2(t)> - < s(t)>^2$ which provide full description
	of the diffusion process. The comparison of the analytic results

  abstract = {The theoretical possibility of fluid-fluid phase separation in systems
	of charged colloidal suspensions has been previously explored by
	several researchers. Here we expand upon a previous treatment using
	the methods of density functional theory, and finding a one-body
	volume term in the free energy, which affects the system's phase
	behaviour. We consider the effects of including correlational terms
	at the level of the local density approximation, and recover the
	correct limiting behaviour. We find that we may draw connections
	with the use of McMillan-Mayer electrolyte theory, which elucidates
	the physical meaning of the volume term. We further consider the
	effect of explicitly allowing for charge condensation of counterions
	on the colloids. The resulting state-dependent effective charge of
	the polyions has a dramatic effect on the resultant phase behaviour,
	and we predict fluid-fluid phase separation under experimentally
	accessible conditions.},

	The particles carry sulfate functional groups and cover a wide range

	exhibit a pronounced maximum as a function of 1:1 electrolyte (KCl)
	concentrations. With 2:1 and 3:1 electrolytes (CaCl2 and LaCl3 respectively),
	the electrophoretic mobility curves pass through a minimum followed

  abstract = {The sequential adsorption of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes called
	the "layer by layer" technique is a method for formation of ultrathin
	films with controlled thickness and interfacial properties. Composition
	of polyelectrolyte solutions, pH, and electrolyte concentration are
	important parameters governing formation of multilayer films. Since
	pH is the factor controlling charge of weak polyelectrolytes, the
	structure of multilayers should be sensitive to its value. In this
	paper we focused on formation of PE multilayer films composed from
	weak and strong polyelectrolytes. We used weak, branched polycation
	polyethyleneimine (PEI, 70 kDa) and strong polyanion poly-4-styrenesulfonate
	(PSS, 70 kDa) to form films by the layer-by-layer technique on the
	surface of silicon wafers under two deposition conditions: pH = 6
	when PEI was strongly charged and pH = 10.5 when the charge density
	of PEI was low. Thicknesses of films were measured by single wavelength
	ellipsometry, and the results were confronted with ones concerning
	mass of the adsorbed films obtained by quartz crystal microbalance.
	We found that, depending on pH of the solutions, combination of weakly
	and strongly charged polyelectrolytes gave either linear or nonmonotonic
	increase of film thickness with a number of deposited PE layers.
	We observed a good correlation between multilayer film thickness
	and adsorbed mass. The atomic force microscopy images of surface
	topography of PEI/PSS films demonstrated large differences between
	films deposited at pH = 6 and 10.5. Additionally the cyclic voltamperometry
	was used to determine the differences in permeability of films formed
	at various pH conditions.},

  abstract = {Capillary electrophoresis has widely contributed to the analysis of
	biological polyelectrolytes like DNA or proteins. Their behavior
	in the different electrophoretic separation systems is well understood.
	However, this knowledge is rather limited in the case of synthetic
	polyelectrolytes. This paper discusses our results on how it is possible
	to gain information on size, shape, and mobility from capillary electrophoresis
	experiments, Capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE) is the most valuable
	method for size characterization of polyelectrolytes. Different separation
	principles and sieving media are presented and an optimization concept
	is evaluated. Capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) and capillary
	isoelectric focussing (cIEF) can be used to study the influence of
	solvent properties such as ionic strength, buffer pH, and temperature
	on the size and surface charge of polycations, polybetames, and polyampholytes
	in free solution. The pH dependence of the mobility can be used for
	the determination of charge neutrality of the surface. Systematic
	variations of structural parameters lead to significant changes in
	electrophoretic behavior. Even the formation of intermolecular associates
	is easily detectable by CZE. All results are in good agreement with
	orthogonal classical polyelectrolyte characterization methods which
	makes capillary electrophoresis a fast and efficient supplement to

	scattering indicate the presence of supramolecular structures, which
	we interpret as large domains of increased polymer concentration.
	In these same solutions, a shorter wavelength correlation is evident
	from the presence of a maximum at finite q in the small-angle scattering
	experiment. Fluctuations on a short wavelength are also apparent
	from the existence of the fast mode in the dynamic light scattering.
	The maximum is interpreted as reflecting a characteristic dimension

	to constrain the fluctuations of the eigenmodes of the phantom model.
	The model allows us to treat the constrained junction and the tube
	model within the same, transparent formalism! does not require any
	further approximations, and is particularly suited for the analysis
	of simulation data for (strained) model polymer networks. As an interesting
	side result we show that in order for the model to be consistent,
	the constraints (but not the mean polymer conformations!) have to
	deform affinely, a severe restriction that might also apply to other
	models. Complementary, we prove in analogy to the derivation of the
	virial theorem that introducing constraints into the phantom network
	Hamiltonian leads to extra terms in addition to the usual Doi-Edwards
	formulas for the polymer contribution to the stress tensor which
	vanish only for affinely deforming constraints.},

  abstract = {The folding pathway of spermidine-induced DNA condensation on the
	surface of mica was examined by varying the concentration of spermidine
	in a dilute DNA solution and visualizing intermediates by atomic
	force microscopy (AFM). Images reveal that spermidine-induced DNA
	condensation on mica involves multiple well-defined structural intermediates;
	At 1.5-3 mu M spermidine there are no interesting morphologies of
	the DNA, although there is a reduction of the apparent persistence
	length. At 7.5-15 mu M spermidine, intramolecular loops (mean diameter
	40 +/- 15 nm) form. Loops initially appear to form independently
	of each other, but individual molecules with multiple loops tend
	to crossover at the same point producing {"}flower{"}-shaped structures.
	At 30 mu M spermidine, the tendency to form single crossover points
	increases and multimolecular flowers form. After initial flower formation
	disklike condensates appear, sometimes as apparent outgrowths from
	flowers. The resolvable strands in:the disks are thicker than double-stranded
	DNA, suggesting a close association of two or more DNA strands and,
	thus, a stabilization of strand-strand interactions along the length
	of the DNA, This strand-strand stabilization is further indicated
	by the formation of very large (>500 nm) multimolecular aggregates,
	at 150 mu M spermidine, composed predominantly of flowers and disks.
	These aggregates are initially planar with a monomolecular thickness
	and few crossover points. At the highest spermidine concentrations
	examined growth in the third dimension is seen as additional layers;
	of condensates formed. These results suggest that there are several
	intermediates early in Spermidine-induced DNA condensation on mica,
	with well-defined characteristics. Some of these intermediates have
	novel intra- and intermolecular contacts.},

  abstract = { A new paradigm for nonlinear doping-controlled ion transport in soft
	condensed matter is presented, where the mobility of a minority probe
	ion is controlled by majority salt ion. The class of materials to
	which this paradigm applies is represented by ultrathin films of
	polyelectrolyte complexes, or multilayers. Intersite hopping of probe
	ions of charge nu occurs only when the charge of the destination
	site, produced by clustering of monovalent salt ions, is at least
	nu, conserving electroneutrality. Salt ions are reversibly doped
	into the multilayer under the influence of external salt concentration.
	In situ ATR-FTIR reveals that the doping level, y, is proportional
	to salt concentration. Because hopping requires coincidence, or clustering,
	of salt, a strongly nonlinear dependence of flux, J, on salt concentration
	is observed: J [NaCl]nu ynu. This scaling was reproduced both by
	Monte Carlo simulations of ion hopping and by continuum probability
	expressions. The theory also predicts the observed scaling, though
	it underestimates the magnitude, of the strong selectivity of multilayers
	for ions of different charge. },

  abstract = {The mechanism of formation of supported lipid layers from phosphatidylcholine
	and phosphatidylserine vesicles in solution on polyelectrolyte multilayers
	was studied by a variety of experimental techniques. The interaction
	of zwitterionic and acidic lipid vesicles, as well as their mixtures,
	with polyelectrolyte supports was followed in real time by micro-gravimetry.
	The fabricated lipid-polyelectrolyte composite structures on top
	of multilayer coated colloidal particles were characterized by flow
	cytometry and imaging techniques. Lipid diffusion over the macroscopic
	scale was quantified by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching,
	and the diffusion was related to layer connectivity. The phospholipid-polyelectrolyte
	binding mechanism was investigated by infrared spectroscopy. A strong
	interaction of polyelectrolyte primary amino groups with phosphate
	and carboxyl groups of the phospholipids, leading to dehydration,
	was observed. Long-range electrostatic attraction was proven to be
	essential for vesicle spreading and rupture. Fusion of lipid patches
	into a homogeneous bilayer required lateral mobility of the lipids
	on the polyelectrolyte support. The binding of amino groups to the
	phosphate group of the zwitterionic lipids was too weak to induce
	vesicle spreading, but sufficient for strong adsorption. Only the
	mixture of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine resulted in
	the spontaneous formation of bilayers on polyelectrolyte multilayers.
	The adsorption of phospholipids onto multilayers displaying quarternary
	ammonium polymers produced a novel 3D lipid polyelectrolyte structure
	on colloidal particles.},

  abstract = {The dynamical, conformational, and transport properties of short flexible
	polyelectrolytes are studied in salt-free solution under the influence
	of an external electric field taking hydrodynamic interactions into
	account. A coarse-grained polymer model is applied and the multiparticle
	collision dynamics approach is adopted to account for the solvent.
	We consider various Coulomb interaction strengths and polymer lengths.
	The scaling behavior of the diffusion coefficient with respect to
	polymer length strongly depends on the charge interaction strength
	due to changes in the polyelectrolyte conformations by counterion
	condensation. The diffusion coefficients at weak Coulomb interaction
	strengths can well be described by the expression of rodlike objects,
	whereas at stronger electrostatic interactions, we observe a Zimm-like
	behavior. The polyelectrolyte mobilities obey the Nernst-Einstein
	relation at weak charge interactions. For large interaction strengths
	and long polymers, the mobilities are independent of molecular weight
	because of the screening of the intramolecular Coulomb interactions
	by counterions. Our studies demonstrated that the dynamics of polyelectrolytes
	in dilute solution and in an external field is governed by an interplay
	of hydrodynamic interactions and counterion condensation.},

  abstract = {Abstract: The structure of bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (TFSI-)
	in the liquid state has been studied by means of Raman spectroscopy
	and DFT calculations. Raman spectra of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium
	(EMI+) TFSI- show relatively strong bands arising from TFSI- at about
	398 and 407 cm-1. Interestingly, the 407 cm-1 band, relative to the
	398 cm-1 one, is appreciably intensified with raising temperature,
	suggesting that an equilibrium is established between TFSI- conformers
	in the liquid state. According to DFT calculations followed by normal
	frequency analyses, two conformers of C2 and C1 symmetry, respectively,
	constitute global and local minima, with an energy difference 2.2-3.3
	kJ mol-1. The wagging -SO2 vibration appears at 396 and 430 cm-1
	for the C1 conformer and at 387 and 402 cm-1 for the C2 one. Observed
	Raman spectra over the range 380-440 cm-1 were deconvoluted to extract
	intrinsic bands of TFSI- conformers, and the enthalpy of conformational
	change from C2 to C1 was evaluated. The enthalpy value is in good
	agreement with that obtained by theoretical calculations. We thus
	conclude that a conformational equilibrium is established between
	the C1 and C2 conformers of TFSI- in the liquid EMI+TFSI-, and the
	C2 conformer is more favorable than the C1 one.},

  abstract = {The Born model of ionic solids is shown to permit the complete determination
	from solid-state data of crystal radii for the alkali and halogen
	ions in the individual alkali halides with the NaCl structure, which
	are directly comparable with the experimental crystal radii deducible
	from the X-ray maps for the electron distribution in the crystal.
	The determination is based on the direct relationships which are
	established, by a physical interpretation of the observed approximate
	additivity of the interionic distance, between the crystal radii
	and the parameters entering plausible expressions for the first and
	second neighbor contributions to the Born repulsive energy. Two different
	forms of the repulsive energy are considered : the Huggins-Mayer
	form, having an exponential dependence on the ionic distance with
	a hardness parameter common to the family of salts, and the Pauling
	form, having an inverse-power dependence on the ionic distance, again
	with a common hardness parameter. The parameters for these forms
	are determined from solid-state data by a Huggins-type procedure.
	The crystal radii of the alkali and halogen ions in the NaCl structure
	obtained with the Huggins-Mayer form are, respectively, larger and
	smaller than the traditional crystal radii by about two-tenths of
	an angstrom. Their uncertainty is estimated to be about 0.05 ???
	by comparison with the crystal radii obtained with the Pauling form.
	The crystal radii of the ions in NaCl and LiF agree rather closely
	with those deduced from the X-ray maps of the electron distribution
	available for these crystals. The value of the determination of electron
	maps for other alkali halide crystals is emphasized, to test in particular
	the significance of the small regular variations of the crystal radius
	of an ion from crystal to crystal suggested by the calculations.
	The applicability of the Born model procedure for the determination
	of crystal radii to other families of ionic solids is pointed out.},

  abstract = { Because the formation of protein/polysaccharide complexes is dominated
	by electrostatic interaction, polysaccharide charge density is expected
	to play a major role in the adsorption behavior of the complexes.
	In this study, pullulan (a non-charged polysaccharide) carboxylated
	to four different charge densities (fraction of carboxylated subunits:
	0.1, 0.26, 0.51, and 0.56) was used to investigate the effect of
	charge density on the properties of mixed protein/polysaccharide
	adsorbed layers at air/water interfaces. With all pullulan samples,
	soluble complexes with beta-lactoglobulin could be formed at low
	ionic strength, pH 4.5. It was shown that the higher was the pullulan
	charge density, the more the increase of surface pressure in time
	was retarded as compared to that for pure beta-lactoglobulin. The
	retardation was even more pronounced for the development of the dilatational
	modulus. The lower dilatational modulus can be explained by the ability
	of the polysaccharides to prevent the formation of a compact protein
	layer at the air/water interface due to electrostatic repulsion.
	This ability of the polysaccharides to prevent layer compactness
	increases with the net negative charge of the complexes. If charge
	density is sufficient (0.26), polysaccharides may enhance the cohesion
	between complexes within the adsorbed layer. The charge density of
	polysaccharides is shown to be a dominant regulator of both the adsorption
	kinetics as well as the resulting surface rheological behavior of
	the mixed layers formed. These findings have significant value for
	the application of complex proteinpolysaccharide systems. },

	Ba2+ cation. The ionic sizes estimated from the effective potentials
	are not pairwise additive, a feature in the frequently used primitive
	model for electrolytes. The effective potentials were used in Monte
	Carlo (MC) simulations with implicit water to calculate mean ion
	activity coefficients of LiCl, NaCl, KCl, MgCl2, CaCl2, SrCl2, and
	BaCl2. Predicted activities were compared with experimental ones
	in the electrolyte concentration range 0.1-1 M. A qualitative agreement
	for LiCl and a satisfactory agreement for NaCl were found, whereas
	the predictions for KCl by two K+ models were less coherent. In the
	case of alkaline earth metal ions, all experimental activities were
	successfully reproduced at c = 0.1 M. However, at higher concentrations,
	similar deviations occurred for all divalent cations, suggesting
	that the dependence of the permittivity on the salt concentration
	and the polarization deficiency arising from the ordering of water
	molecules in the ion hydration shells are important in such systems.},

	AFM-related force measurements. Multilayers were assembled on a prelayer
	of poly(ethylenimine) (PEI) both with and without drying. SPR results
	showed a linear growth of the assembly in the case of PSS/PAH multilayers
	and nonlinear growth for DNA/PAH multilayers. Measurements of forces
	acting between a bare glass sphere and a multilayer-coated surface
	indicated repulsive or attractive forces, depending on surface charge,
	which suggests that, on approach, electrostatic forces dominate.
	On separation, we observed large pull-off forces in the case of positively
	charged multilayers and weak pull-off forces in the case negatively
	charged multilayers. Multiple adhesions and plateau regions observed
	on separation were interpreted in terms of a bridging of multiple
	polymer chains between the glass particle and the multilayer and
	a stretching of the polyelectrolyte loops. The dependence of the
	pull-off force on the number of deposited layers shows regular oscillations.

	acid-co-maleic acid, 1:1 SS:MA) sodium salt (PSSMA 1:1) as the building

	faster and slower growth of the layer thickness in higher concentration

	the multilayers were highly hydrated with a factor of 3 [similar]
	9 in a wet state depending on the type and concentration of the salts

	used during the assembly also influenced greatly the compression
	ratio of the polyelectrolyte multilayers, i.e. the compression ratio
	increased along with the increase of NaCl concentration, whereas
	it was constant when NaBr was used. The friction force of the PEI(PSSMA/PDADMAC)7
	multilayers measured by SFM showed that the force peaks gradually
	shifted from low to high scanning frequency along with the increase
	of NaCl concentration, illustrating the gradual softening of the
	multilayers. By contrast, the peak positions in the friction force
	curves for all the multilayers assembled in NaBr solution kept unchanged
	regardless of the NaBr concentration. Contrast experiments further
	revealed that the compression ratios, masses in wet and wet thicknesses
	of the multilayers alternatingly treated in Cl- and in Br- solutions

	In this case the NMR signal experiences phase modulation due to flow
	and signal attenuation due to the distribution of velocities. The
	velocity distribution consists of one part originating from diffusion
	and of a second part, the distribution of the directed motion. The
	usual PFG-experiment in which the gradient strength is incremented
	cannot distinguish between both. Incrementing velocity at constant
	gradient strength keeps the contribution from diffusion constant
	but changes the absolute width of the velocity distribution. So the
	signal is attenuated again, but only due to the distribution of the
	directed motion. The phase modulation as a signature of flow is not
	affected by this strategy, because velocity and gradient strength
	are Fourier conjugated. The key advantage of this approach is the
	possibility of measuring very low velocities, which only cause a
	very slight phase modulation that is easily covered by diffusion.
	The method is discussed here for very slow flow in a rheometer cell.

	of PEM thin films and the deformation characteristics of the EAPs.
	The PEM films were made of poly(l-glutamic acid) (PGA) and poly(allylamine
	hydrochloride) (PAH). After [Fe(CN)6]4 ??? ions (FCIV) were added,
	cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed, resulting in a reversible
	expansion and contraction of the film. The shape change as well as
	the film buildup prior to the cycling were monitored in situ using
	the electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation
	monitoring (EC-QCM-D). Electrochemical atomic force microscopy (EC-AFM)
	images confirmed the rapid shape deformation. The process takes place
	in an aqueous environment under mild conditions (maximum potential
	of 600 mV and no pH change), which makes it a promising tool for
	biomedical applications. In addition, the electrochemically active
	films are produced using the layer-by-layer (LbL) method that is
	already established in biotechnology and biomaterials science; therefore,
	the presented approach can be readily adapted in these areas, bringing
	about a new possibility for the nanoscale dynamic control of coating
	thickness in various applications. },

  abstract = {We present a method to identify single-stranded PCR products of varying
	lengths by hybridization of n-alkylated peptide nucleic acids (PNA
	amphiphiles) to the products, followed by separation with micellar
	electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC). These end-attached PNA amphiphiles
	(PNAA) partition to nonionic micelles in the running buffer (Triton
	X-100), linking the tagged DNA to the micellar drag-tag. This linkage
	shifts the electrophoretic mobility of a tagged component away from
	both untagged DNA and tagged DNA of different lengths. The mobility
	of the tagged DNA is established by its extent of partitioning to
	the micelle phase as well as its size relative to the attached micelle.
	A model is presented that can be used to determine the length of
	an unknown oligomer given an experimentally obtained mobility. We
	find that the collective action of micelles that transiently attach
	to the tagged DNA impart about the same hydrodynamic drag as covalently
	bound '' drag-tags '' of a similar size. With the use of the PNAA-MEKC
	method, PCR products of 88, 134, 216, and 447 biases are clearly
	resolved in less than 5 min. To our knowledge, this work represents
	the first use of surfactant micelles as drag-tags to separate DNA
	in capillary electrophoresis. Furthermore, the PNAA tag only attaches
	to DNA containing a target sequence, helping ensure that only the
	desired PCR products are analyzed.},

  abstract = {We describe a charge-stabilized colloidal suspension within a Poisson-Boltzmann
	cell model and calculate the free energy as well as the compressibility
	as a function of colloidal density. The same quantities are also
	calculated from the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation. Comparing
	nonlinear with linear theory, we test the quality of different linearization
	schemes. For concentrated suspensions, linearization about the Donnan
	potential is shown to be preferable to standard Debye-H{\"u}ckel
	linearization. We also show that the volume term theory proposed
	earlier follows from a linearization about the Donnan potential.
	Using this linearization scheme, we nd a gas-liquid phase coexistence
	in linear, but not in nonlinear theory. This result may imply that
	predictions of a spinodal instability in highly de-ionized colloidal
	suspensions are spurious.},

	and the air/aqueous interface (liquid supported). For the solid-supported
	multilayers, the adsorption kinetics and the complex shear modulus
	were measured using a dissipative quartz crystal microbalance and
	a null ellipsometer. A bubble tensiometer was used to measure the
	adsorption kinetics and the elasticity modulus of the liquid-supported
	multilayers. At the solid/aqueous interface, adsorption kinetics
	changes with the number of adsorbed layers. However, at the air/aqueous
	interface, PSS dynamics were the same for all adsorbed layers except
	the first. Conversely, the adsorption kinetics of PDADMAC at the
	air/water surface differed between those layers close to the interface
	and those far from it. Multilayers grow at the air/water interface
	by an intrinsic-charge-compensation process, whereas, for the same
	ionic strengths, solid-supported layers deposit by the extrinsic-charge-compensation
	process. No significant differences were found between the recoverable
	dilational storage modulus of the liquid-supported multilayers and
	the real part of the shear modulus of the solid-supported ones built
	at the same ionic strength. The values of the modulus are in the
	MPa range, which corresponds to gel-like films. This result is in
	agreement with the strong hydration degree of the LbL films calculated
	from ellipsometry measurements.},

	where l(0) is the bare persistence length, l(B) is the Bjerrum length,
	and A is the mean distance between charges along the chain. Several
	distinct regimes for the dependence of l(e) on kappa emerge depending
	on the value of l(0)l(B)/A(2). We show that when l(0)l(B)/A(2) much
	less than 1 we recover the classical result, l(e)(proportional to)kappa(-2).
	For intermediate values of l(0)l(B)/A(2), l(e)(proportional to)kappa(-1).
	In this regime one can also get l(e)(proportional to)kappa(-y) with

  volume = {62},
  pages = {251},
  abstract = {The calculation of rate coefficients is a discipline of nonlinear
	science of importance to much of physics, chemistry, engineering,
	and biology. Fifty years after Kramers' seminal paper on thermally
	activated barrier crossing, the authors report, extend, and interpret
	much of our current understanding relating to theories of noise-activated
	escape, for which many of the notable contributions are originating
	from the communities both of physics and of physical chemistry. Theoretical
	as well as numerical approaches are discussed for single- and many-dimensional
	metastable systems (including fields) in gases and condensed phases.
	The role of many-dimensional transition-state theory is contrasted
	with Kramers' reaction-rate theory for moderate-to-strong friction;
	the authors emphasize the physical situation and the close connection
	between unimolecular rate theory and Kramers' work for weakly damped
	systems. The rate theory accounting for memory friction is presented,
	together with a unifying theoretical approach which covers the whole
	regime of weak-to-moderate-to-strong friction on the same basis (turnover
	theory). The peculiarities of noise-activated escape in a variety
	of physically different metastable potential configurations is elucidated
	in terms of the mean-first-passage-time technique. Moreover, the
	role and the complexity of escape in driven systems exhibiting possibly
	multiple, metastable stationary nonequilibrium states is identified.
	At lower temperatures, quantum tunneling effects start to dominate
	the rate mechanism. The early quantum approaches as well as the latest
	quantum versions of Kramers' theory are discussed, thereby providing
	a description of dissipative escape events at all temperatures. In
	addition, an attempt is made to discuss prominent experimental work
	as it relates to Kramers' reaction-rate theory and to indicate the
	most important areas for future research in theory and experiment.},

	solid state. As in the crystal structure, hydrogen-bonding interactions
	between the ring hydrogens and the chloride dominate the structure.

  abstract = {The development of innovative technologies designed to reduce the
	cost and increase the throughput of DNA separations continues to
	be important for large-scale sequencing and genotyping efforts. We
	report research aimed at the further development of a free-solution
	bioconjugate method of DNA size separation by capillary electrophoresis
	(CE), in particular, the determination of an optimal molecular architecture
	for polyamide-based "drag-tags". We synthesized several branched
	poly(N-methoxyethyl glycine)s (poly(NMEG)s, a class of polypeptoids)
	as novel friction-generating entities for end-on attachment to DNA
	molecules. A 30-mer poly(NMEG) "backbone," comprising five evenly
	spaced reactive E-amino groups, was synthesized on solid phase, cleaved,
	and purified to monodispersity by RP-HPLC. Three different comblike
	derivatives of this backbone molecule were created by (1) acetylating
	the c-amino groups or (2) appending small, monodisperse NMEG oligomers
	(a tetramer and an octamer). Grafting of the oligo(NMEG)s was done
	using solution-phase amide bond formation chemistry. Once purified
	to total monodispersity, the three different drag-tags were studied
	by free-solution electrophoresis to observe the effect of branching
	on their hydrodynamic drag or "alpha" and hence their ability to
	separate DNA. Drag was found to scale linearly with total molecular
	weight, regardless of branch length. The octamer-branched drag-tag-DNA
	conjugate was used to separate ssDNA products of 50, 75, 100, and
	150 bases in length by free-solution CE in less than 10 min. Hence,
	the use of branched or comblike drag-tags is both a feasible and
	an effective way to achieve high frictional drag, allowing the high-resolution
	separation of relatively large DNA molecules by free-solution CE
	without the need to synthesize very long polymers.},

  abstract = { Research on polypeptide multilayer films, coatings, and microcapsules
	is located at the intersection of several disciplines: synthetic
	polymer chemistry and physics, biomaterials science, and nanoscale
	engineering. The past few years have witnessed considerable growth
	in each of these areas. Unexplored territory has been found at the
	borders, and new possibilities for technology development are taking
	form from technological advances in polypeptide production, sequencing
	of the human genome, and the nature of peptides themselves. Most
	envisioned applications of polypeptide multilayers have a biomedical
	bent. Prospects seem no less positive, however, in fields ranging
	from food technology to environmental science. This review of the
	present state of polypeptide multilayer film research covers key
	points of polypeptides as materials, means of polymer production
	and film preparation, film characterization methods, focal points
	of current research in basic science, and the outlook for a few specific
	applications. In addition, it discusses how the study of polypeptide
	multilayer films could help to clarify the physical basis of assembly
	and stability of polyelectrolyte multilayers, and mention is made
	of similarities to protein folding studies. },

  abstract = {The dispersion state of sodium-sulphonated polystyrene (NaPSS) star-branched
	polyelectrolytes was investigated in salt-free aqueous solutions,
	by use of the small-angle X-ray scattering technique. With respect
	to polystyrene (PS) star-branched polymers of identical functionality,
	the ordering phenomenon occurring in the neighborhood of the overlap
	concentration c* is reinforced and observed in a larger range of
	concentrations. Moreover, the degree of order is no longer maximum
	at c* and is improved as the concentration decreases. The dispersion
	state is then mainly controlled by the electrostatic interaction.
	A crystalline order should therefore be achieved with stars of lower
	functionality, provided the electrostatic interaction is added to
	the osmotic repulsion. On the other hand, unusual scattering patterns
	are measured for aqueous solutions of NaPSS star polyelectrolytes,
	Indeed, a diffuse scattering is revealed at high angles, in addition
	to the regular diffraction rings related to preferred interstar distances.
	It is similar to the broad scattering peak produced Ly semidilute
	solutions of NaPSS linear polyelectrolytes and associated to the
	electrostatic correlation hole within the isotropic model. In the
	dilute regime (c < c*), it is just an intramolecular characteristic
	and represents the electrostatic repulsion between arms belonging
	to the same star. In the semidilute regime (c > c*), it also reflects
	the electrostatic repulsion between arms of distinct stars. So, as
	the concentration increases, it is mainly caused by the interpenetration
	of NaPSS stars. Such an observation is in agreement with the composite
	structure earlier proposed by Daoud and Cotton for star semidilute
	solutions. For c > c*, NaPSS star aqueous solutions can therefore
	be pictured as effective stars immersed in a matrix formed by the
	overlap of the arm ends. With respect to the dilute regime, the effective
	stars are smaller; the higher the concentration the smaller the size.},

	<i>Phys. Rev.</i> E, <b>69</b>, 046702, (2004)] developed a technique

	aqueous electrolytes. The simulations include two dielectric boundaries,
	one from an inner layer of low dielectric coefficient and one from
	an uncharged metal electrode. In addition, an extension of a Poisson-Boltzmann
	(PB) type theory due to Onsager and Samara [L. Onsager, N.N.T. Samara.

	Light scattering experiments suggest that the number of PPP oligomers

	used, this number dramatically increases to 60 oligomers. Here, we
	show that the basic packing of the PPP oligomers does not change

	among bundles goes from repulsive to attractive as the counterions
	are changed from Na+ to Ca2+. We propose that the observed aggregate

	The code encompasses a minimal-communication domain decomposition

	constraint solver, and efficient virtual site algorithms that allow
	removal of hydrogen atom degrees of freedom to enable integration
	time steps up to 5 fs for atomistic simulations also in parallel.
	To improve the scaling properties of the common particle mesh Ewald
	electrostatics algorithms, we have in addition used a Multiple-Program,
	Multiple-Data approach, with separate node domains responsible for
	direct and reciprocal space interactions. Not only does this combination
	of algorithms enable extremely long simulations of large systems
	but also it provides that simulation performance on quite modest
	numbers of standard cluster nodes.},

	We performed molecular simulations with quantitatively accurate models

	weak solvent-shared ion pairs. The relative insignificance of contact

	is governed by interactions mediated through hydration water molecules.},

  year = {1996},

  pages = {1},
  abstract = {The purpose of this article is to present some important advances
	in the electrokinetic and colloidal characterization of polymer colloids.
	Special attention is paid to the new electrokinetic techniques: diffusiophoresis,
	dielectric dispersion and electro-acoustic. Also the most recent
	theoretical approaches are reviewed with respect to the electrokinetic
	properties of polymer colloids. Recently there has been intense discussion
	concerning electrokinetic processes and the theories used for data
	interpretation. Several concerns have been raised relating to the
	inability of the different processes and theories to yield the same
	electrokinetic potential. The most important explanations (shear
	plane expansion, preferential ion adsorption, osmotic swelling, crossing
	of the mobility/zeta-potential and anomalous surface conductance)
	to the electrokinetic behaviour of polymer colloids are discussed
	and analyzed. Also the effect of heat treatment on the electrokinetic
	properties of different types of polymer colloids is extensively
	considered. With regard to the colloidal stability of polymer colloids,
	three- and two-dimensional aggregations are presented. First, the
	stability factor W is introduced using the classical theory DLVO
	and the values obtained of Hamaker constant compared with the theoretical
	values estimated from the Lifshitz theory. The differences usually
	found by several authors are explained as due to the hydrodynamic
	interaction. Special attention is paid to the extended DLVO theory
	for studying homocoagulation of polymer colloids in three dimensions
	and to the new expressions for the van der Waals, electrostatic and
	structural forces that must be deduced to study the colloidal stability
	of polymer colloids in two dimensions. Also, the heterocoagulation
	of polymer colloids with different sign of surface charge density
	and particle size is reviewed, and a new definition of the heterocoagulation
	stability factor is given. The aggregation kinetics of polymer colloids
	in three dimensions is analyzed using the Smoluchowski theory (in
	terms of the reaction kernels k(ij)) in the cases where the Smoluchowski's
	equation is analytically solvable (constant, sum, product kernel
	and linear combinations thereof). The dynamic scaling in aggregation
	phenomena with polymer colloids is studied using the classification
	scheme for homogeneous kernels due to Van Dongen and Ernst based
	on the relative probabilities of large clusters sticking to large
	clusters, and small clusters sticking to large clusters. The techniques
	(multiparticle and single particle detection) enabling us to provide
	cluster-size distribution of aggregating polymer colloids are also
	presented. Finally, the aggregation kinetics of two dimensional aggregation
	of polymer colloids is studied on the basis of the fractal dimension
	of the aggregates. The different scaling theories for two-dimensional
	aggregation are also considered.},

  abstract = {The motion of a spherical polymer-coated colloidal particle in a steady
	electric field is studied via ``exact'' numerical solutions of the
	electrokinetic equations. The hydrodynamic influence of the polymer
	is represented by a distribution of Stokes resistance centers. With
	neutral polymer, charge resides on the underlying bare particle,
	whereas for polyelectrolytes, the charge is distributed throughout
	the coating. The coatings may be brush-like or have long tails. As
	expected, neutral coatings lower the mobility because of increased
	drag and a decrease in the effective charge behind the shear surface.
	For polyelectrolyte coatings, the behavior is more complex. For example,
	the mobility becomes independent of the ionic strength and particle
	size when Donnan equilibrium prevails inside the coating and the
	coating is thick relative to the Brinkman screening length (square
	root of the coating permeability). In this limit, the mobility follows
	from a simple balance of forces within the coating and, therefore,
	becomes proportional to the fixed charge density and the coating
	permeability. If the permeability is sufficiently high, the mobility
	of a polyelectrolyte-coated particle may exceed that of its bare
	counterpart with the same net charge. In general, the effects of
	polarization and relaxation are as important for coated particles
	as they are for bare particles. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

	with mobilities reported in the literature and predicted by theory.
	For ionic strengths below 0.1 M, the capillary method is more accurate
	and rapid than previous techniques; it also provides a distribution
	of mobility values for polyelectrolyte mixtures. A maximum of the
	free solution mobility with respect to chain length is discovered
	in the oligomer range for both poly(styrenesulfonate) and ss-DNA;
	lowering ionic strength accentuates this unexplained phenomenon.
	In the large chain limit, where the mobility is independent of chain
	length, the ionic strength dependences of mobility for all three
	polymers are remarkably similar. These dependences can only be explained
	by models that incorporate nonlinear electrostatic effects into the
	description of the counterion cloud. The Manning model (with relaxation
	correction) best approximates the dependence of mobility on ionic
	strength.},

	dipping time is not long enough for unbound polycations to uniformly
	distribute inside the film. Additionally, for a film to exhibit exponential
	growth, it is essential that very few unbound polycations move out
	of the film during the rinsing step that follows after dipping in
	a solution of polycations. The model predicts that this criterion
	is satisfied either when a sharply peaked energetic barrier is present
	at the film surface or when the film swells. Furthermore, the model
	predicts that when dipping time, t(d), is increased proportionally
	with H(2), where H is the film thickness, the film will grow exponentially
	as long as k(d)t(d) << 1, where k(d) is the dissolution rate. The
	results of this work shed light on the criteria that need to be satisfied
	for a film to grow exponentially, and could help in exercising better
	control over the thickness of polyelectrolyte multilayer films.},

  abstract = {The accurate description of solvation effects is highly desirable
	in numerous computational chemistry applications. One widely used
	methodology treats the solvent as a uniform continuum (?implicit
	solvation?), and describes its net interaction with the solute by
	solving the Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation using the Boundary Element
	Method (BEM). These calculations are very time consuming using conventional
	computers. A new, efficient way of solving the PB equation on the
	special-purpose hardware chip MDGRAPE-2 is presented. The MDGRAPE-2
	chip was originally developed to speed up the calculation of pairwise
	van der Waals and electrostatic interactions. By recasting the BEM
	equations and applying an iterative solution procedure, a hardware-accelerated
	PB solver on MDGRAPE-2 could be implemented. The performance and
	reliability of the method is demonstrated on three examples ranging
	from small peptides to large proteins, whereby the obtained acceleration
	factors range from 15-fold to up to 40-fold with no loss of accuracy
	compared to the conventional approach. {\copyright}2005 Wiley Periodicals,

  abstract = {We have studied the adsorption of [small alpha]-lactalbumin at a planar
	poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) brush using neutron reflectometry (NR) and
	total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) spectroscopy. The PAA
	brush has been prepared by spin-coating silicon or quartz plates
	with a hydrophobic poly(styrene) film and by transferring the copolymer
	poly(styrene)-poly(acrylic acid) onto the modified surface. In the
	case of NR, the poly(styrene) film and the poly(styrene) chain ends
	of the copolymer were perdeuterated in order to generate a high contrast
	to the non-deuterated PAA brush. [small alpha]-Lactalbumin was chosen
	as the model protein because it is a relatively small globular protein
	with a negative net charge at neutral pH-values, as chosen in the
	experiments. Thus, it is interacting with the PAA brush on the 'wrong'
	side of its isoelectric point. In addition, the effects of temperature
	on the volume fraction profile and the reorientational mobility of
	the protein within the PAA brush were determined. From the analysis
	of the NR data, it has been found that despite of its negative net
	charge, [small alpha]-lactalbumin is penetrating into the PAA brush.
	Its volume fraction profile parallels that of the PAA brush, indicating
	an exclusive interaction between the protein and the PAA. No protein
	accumulation is found at the inner poly(styrene) or the outer solution
	interface of the PAA brush. When increasing the temperature from
	20 to 40 [degree]C, less protein is adsorbed, suggesting the presence
	of enthalpic interaction contributions. From the analysis of the
	TIRF data, a high degree of reorientational mobility of [small alpha]-lactalbumin
	within a PAA brush can be inferred. The reorientational correlation
	time of [small alpha]-lactalbumin labeled with the Alexa Fluor 488
	dye was found to increase from 5.5 to 32 ns upon adsorption, which
	can well be explained by the higher viscosity inside the PAA brush.
	Overall, the results of this study quantify for the first time the
	molecular details of the unique interaction of a protein on the 'wrong'
	side of its isoelectric point with a planar charged brush interface.
	It is concluded that the high mobility of [small alpha]-lactalbumin
	within a PAA brush can partially be understood by the presence of
	repulsive electrostatic interactions. There is no 'freezing' of the
	protein dynamics, which is a precondition for biological activity.},

  abstract = {Rod-like polyelectrolytes represent ideal model systems for a comprehensive
	comparison of theory and experiment because their conformation is
	independent of the ionic strength in the system. Hence, the correlation
	of the counterions to the highly charged macroion can be studied
	without the interference of conformational effects. In this chapter
	the synthesis and the solution behavior of rigid, rod-like cationic
	polyelectrolytes having poly(p-phenylene) (PPP) backbones is reviewed.
	These polymers can be characterized precisely and possess degrees
	of polymerization of up to P-n approximate to 70. The analysis of
	the uncharged precursor polymer demonstrated that the PPP backbone
	has a high persistence length (ca. 22 nm) and hence may be regarded
	in an excellent approximation as rod-like macromolecules. The solution
	properties of the PPP-polyelectrolytes were analyzed using electric
	birefringence, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and osmometry.
	Measurements of the electric birefringence demonstrate that these
	systems form molecularly disperse systems in aqueous solution. The
	dependence of electric birefringence on the concentration of added
	salt indicates that an increase of ionic strength leads to stronger
	binding of counterions to the polyion. Data obtained from osmometry
	and small-angle X-ray scattering can directly be compared to the
	prediction of the Poisson-Boltzmann theory and simulations of the
	restricted primitive model. Semi-quantitative agreement is achieved.},

  title = {Equilibrium properties of a bidisperse ferrofluid with chain aggregates:
	theory and computer simulations},
  journal = {J. Phys.: Condens. Matter},
  year = {2006},
  volume = {18},
  pages = {S2737--S2756},
  abstract = {In this paper we investigate a bidisperse model ferrofluid, where
	the aggregates are treated as flexible chains, under the influence
	of an arbitrary valued external magnetic field. An extensive comparison
	of the theoretical predictions to the results of the computer simulations
	is provided. Both magnetostatic properties and structural observables
	are investigated with the help of the newly developed theoretical
	approach and molecular dynamic simulations. It is shown that the
	results of the cluster analysis are very sensitive to the cluster
	definition. Here we use two different criteria for the particles
	to be bound: an energy criterion which is slightly different in the
	theory and simulations due to technical problems, and an entropy
	criterion which is the same for the molecular dynamics and theoretical
	model. This enables us to compare qualitatively and quantitatively
	theoretical and numerical microstructural observables, as well as
	the macro properties of the bidisperse ferrofluids. Finally, an answer
	to the question which chain criterion should actually be used is
	provided in this paper.},

	Monte Carlo method. The ions are treated in the primitive model approximation,

	for the capillary containing mono- or divalent counterions and size
	symmetric 1:1 or 2:2 electrolytes. Some calculations for the mean
	activity coefficients of the added electrolytes are also reported.
	The Monte Carlo results for the concentration profiles and the electrolyte
	activities are used to asses the validity of the potential theories.
	The modified Poisson-Boltzmann theory is found to be in good agreement
	with the simulation results for both mono- and divalent ions present
	in the solution. As expected, the regular Poisson-Boltzmann theory
	provides reasonable descriptions of solutions containing monovalent

	is compatible with the one of monomers, the chains show extended
	structures at low and at high salt concentrations, whereas at intermediate
	salt concentrations, they acquire compact and prolate structures.
	The swelling exponent of a chain against salt concentration behaves
	in an analogous way as the morphological quantities. Under certain
	condition, the electrostatics gives a negative contribution to the
	persistence length, in companion with a salt-induced mechanical instability
	of polyelectrolytes. Nearly at the same moment, it appears like-charge
	attraction between chains. The equal size of the tetravalent ions
	and the monomers is the optimal condition to attain the strongest
	attraction between chains and the most compact chain structure. Moreover,
	the ions form a multilayer organization around a chain, and thus,
	the integrated charge distribution reveals an oscillatory behavior.

	accepted explanation of this fact is that proteins are nonspecifically
	adsorbed on DNA, and sliding along DNA provides for the faster one-dimensional
	search. Surprisingly, the role of DNA conformation was never considered
	in this context. In this article, we explicitly address the relative
	role of three-dimensional diffusion and one-dimensional sliding along
	coiled or globular DNA and the possibility of correlated readsorption
	of desorbed proteins. We have identified a wealth of new different
	scaling regimes. We also found the maximal possible acceleration
	of the reaction due to sliding. We found that the maximum on the
	rate-versus-ionic strength curve is asymmetric, and that sliding
	can lead not only to acceleration, but also in some regimes to dramatic
	deceleration of the reaction.},

  abstract = {In this work, we investigate the slow dynamics of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium
	hexafluorophosphate, a very popular room-temperature ionic solvent.
	Our study predicts the existence of heterogeneity in the liquid and
	shows that this heterogeneity is the underlying microscopic cause
	for the recently reported "red-edge effect" (REE) observed in the
	study of fluorescence of the organic probe 2-amino-7-nitrofluorene.
	This theoretical work explains in microscopic terms the relation
	between REE and dynamic heterogeneity in a room-temperature ionic
	liquid (IL). The REE is typical of micellar or colloidal systems,
	which are characterized by microscopic environments that are structurally
	very different. In contrast, in the case of this room-temperature
	IL, the REE occurs because of the long period during which molecules
	are trapped in quasistatic local solvent cages. This trapping time,
	which is longer than the lifetime of the excited-state probe, together
	with the inability of the surroundings to adiabatically relax, induces
	a set of site-specific spectroscopic responses. Subensembles of fluorescent
	molecules associated with particular local environments absorb and
	emit at different frequencies. We describe in detail the absorption
	wavelength-dependent emission spectra of 2-amino-7-nitrofluorene
	and show that this dependence on lambda(ex) is characteristic of
	the IL and, as is to be expected, is absent in the case of a normal
	solvent such as methanol.},

	(RDF) and diffusion behavior of macroions on the basis of the coarse
	grained model. For comparison, the system containing macroions and
	the PE with only one charged head (one-head PE) is also investigated.
	The simulation results indicate that, at low concentrations, the
	bridging effect of the two-heads PE chain leads to correlation of
	macroions. The reason is that at low concentration the gyration radius
	of the PE chain is less than the average distance between two macroions.
	When the two-heads PE chains are adsorbed on different macroions,
	the bridging effect of the PE chain dominates the RDF and diffusion
	behavior of the macroions. With the increase of the concentration
	of the system, when the gyration radius of the PE chain is greater
	than the average distance between two macroions, the bridging effect
	of the PE chain becomes trivial. By investigating the mechanism of
	the two-heads PE chain affecting the static and dynamic properties

  abstract = {The structure of a ferrofluid under the influence of an external magnetic
	field is expected to become anisotropic due to the alignment of the
	dipoles into the direction of the external field, and subsequently
	to the formation of particle chains due to the attractive head to
	tail orientations of the ferrofluid particles. Knowledge about the
	structure of a colloidal ferrofluid can be inferred from scattering
	data via the measurement of structure factors. We have used molecular-dynamics
	simulations to investigate the structure of both monodispersed and
	polydispersed ferrofluids. The results for the isotropic structure
	factor for monodispersed samples are similar to previous data by
	Camp and Patey that were obtained using an alternative Monte Carlo
	simulation technique, but in a different parameter region. Here we
	look in addition at bidispersed samples and compute the anisotropic
	structure factor by projecting the q vector onto the XY and XZ planes
	separately, when the magnetic field was applied along the z axis.
	We observe that the XY-plane structure factor as well as the pair
	distribution functions are quite different from those obtained for
	the XZ plane. Further, the two-dimensional structure factor patterns
	are investigated for both monodispersed and bidispersed samples under
	different conditions. In addition, we look at the scaling exponents
	of structure factors. Our results should be of value to interpret
	scattering data on ferrofluids obtained under the influence of an

  abstract = {Recent progress in atomic force microscopy (AFM) technology has allowed
	the measurement of inter- and intramolecular forces at the level
	of individual molecules. The mechanical manipulation of single polymer
	chains immobilized on solid substrates has become possible in solution,
	as they are spanned and stretched between the tip of an AFM cantilever
	and the substrate surface. This investigation of polymer chains far
	from their maximum entropy configurations has stimulated the refinement
	of existing polymer theories. From the measured force-distance curves
	quantitative information can be obtained on the elasticity of single
	macromolecules in solution, on conformational transitions along the
	chains, about the mechanical stability of chemical bonds and on secondary
	structures, as well as on the desorption of individual polymer molecules
	from solid substrates. Recent applications of AFM single molecule
	force spectroscopy reach from the study of dynamic processes in complex
	biological systems and intermolecular forces in colloidal systems
	to the investigation of new functional materials capable of performing
	energy transductions on the level of individual macromolecules. In
	this article, we present a detailed description of the experimental
	procedure, followed by an overview of the development, the success
	and the current challenges of this technique during the past five
	years, in which it has rapidly evolved from the first proof of principle
	to a highly active field of research.},

	Cl ion pairs, [C4C1im]Cl, in order to deepen our understanding of
	ionic liquids in general. Examination of charge densities, natural
	bond orbitals (NBO), and delocalised molecular orbitals computed
	at the B3LYP and MP2/6-31++G(d,p) levels have enabled us to explain
	a number of experimental phenomena: the relative acidity of different
	sites on the imidazolium ring, variations in hydrogen-bond donor
	and acceptor abilities, the apparent contradiction of the hydrogen-bond-donor
	parameters for different types of solute, the low probability of
	finding a Cl- anion at the rear of the imidazolium ring and the expansion
	of the imidazolium ring in the presence of a strong hydrogen-bond
	acceptor. The unreactive but coordinating environment and large electrochemical
	window have also been accounted for, as has the strong electron-donating
	character of the carbon atoms to the rear of the ring in associated
	imidazolylidenes. The electronic structure of the [C4C1im]+ cation
	is best described by a C4{$=$}C5 double bond at the rear, and a delocalised
	three-centre 4{e$^-$} component across the front (N1-C2-N3) of the
	imidazolium ring; delocalisation between these regions is also significant.
	Hydrogen-bond formation is driven by Coulombic stabilisation, which
	compensates for an associated destabilisation of the electronic part
	of the system. Interactions are dominated by a large positive charge
	at C2 and the build up of pi-electron density above and below the
	ring, particularly that associated with the double bond between C4
	and C5. The NBO partial charges have been computed and compared with
	those used in a number of classical simulations.},

	computer simulations, here we discuss the validity of the crucial
	assumption of rigid, chain-like aggregates underlying the chain model.
	The simulation results support the existence of chain-like aggregates
	in strongly interacting ferrofluids, at least for sufficiently strong
	magnetic fields. In addition, shear-induced degradation of the clusters
	is observed, which apparently is related to strong shear thinning
	behaviour. For weakly interacting ferrofluids, only slightly anisotropic
	spatial structures are observed. In this regime, the simulation results
	of the magnetoviscous effect are in good agreement with the predictions
	of a dynamical mean-field theory. Further, we explore some first
	steps towards a unified kinetic model that is applicable in both,
	the weakly and strongly interacting regimes.},

	deposition of a polyanion (poly(L-glutamic acid) (PGA)) and polycations
	(poly(L-lysine) (PLL), poly(D-lysine) (PDL), and copoly(DL-lysine)(PDLL))
	was reinvestigated by using in situ ATR-IR spectroscopy. A difference
	spectral technique applied to analyze the spectra indicated that
	the deposition of both the PGA and PLL (PDL) layers accompanies the
	formation of secondary structures consisting mainly of the antiparallel
	pleated sheet (the beta-sheet) structure, and that the formation
	of the beta-sheet structure cannot always be explained in terms of
	polyanion/polycation complex formation or charge compensation between
	the polyanion and polycations, although it has been considered as
	a major process in the multilayer buildup process. Instead, the present
	paper proposes the following mechanism. During the deposition of
	the polyelectrolyte, a small amount of the beta-sheet structures
	are produced at the interface as a result of charge compensation
	between a polyelectrolyte and an oppositely charged polyelectrolyte
	in the multilayer. The beta-sheets act as nuclei from which further
	propagation of the structure takes place at the solution/multilayer
	interfaces. The driving force of the buildup process in the new mechanism
	is a kinetically favorable insolubilization of each polyelectrolyte
	in solution at the interfaces.},

	on the dynamics of DNA translocation through micropores. We simulate
	DNA as a bead-spring chain and use a lattice Boltzmann method to
	simulate the flow field that arises from the motion of the molecule.
	We investigate the free-draining entrance of DNA to the pore by diffusion
	and find that, consistent with experiments, molecules have a higher
	probability of entering the pore from one end. We then consider the
	electric-field driven translocation of 21-210 \mu m DNA with and
	without hydrodynamic interactions. Consistent with experiments, we
	study translocation events that are much shorter than the relaxation
	time of DNA. We find that the effect of hydrodynamic interactions
	on this process is to cause different regions of a molecule, other
	than the ones pulled by voltage or chain connectivity into the pore,
	to move toward the pore. We quantify this effect and show that it
	is smaller than the difference in the translocation dynamics of chains
	that arises from different initial configurations of the molecules.
	A power-law scaling of translocation time with chain length is observed,
	with exponents of 1.28\pm0.03 and 1.31\pm0.03 in simulations with
	and without hydrodynamic interactions, respectively. Our results
	are in good agreement with recent translocation experiments conducted
	in small pores and show that, for the regime considered in this work,
	hydrodynamic interactions play a minor role in the relation of the
	translocation time to chain length. For fast translocation processes,
	the effect of hydrodynamic interactions is local and the main factor
	determining the dynamics of DNA is the initial configuration of the
	molecules.},

  abstract = {We present a fully parametrized bead-spring chain model for stained
	lambda-phage DNA. The model accounts for the finite extensibility
	of the molecule, excluded volume effects, and fluctuating hydrodynamic
	interactions (HI). Parameters are determined from equilibrium experimental
	data for 21 mum stained lambda-phage DNA, and are shown to quantitatively
	predict the non-equilibrium behavior of the molecule. The model is
	then used to predict the equilibrium and nonequilibrium behavior
	of DNA molecules up to 126 mum. In particular, the HI model gives
	results that are in quantitative agreement with experimental diffusivity
	data over a wide range of molecular weights. When the bead friction
	coefficient is fit to the experimental relaxation time at a particular
	molecular weight, the stretch in shear and extensional flows is adequately
	predicted by either a free-draining or HI model at that molecular
	weight, although the fitted bead friction coefficients for the two
	models differ significantly. In shear flow, we find two regimes at
	high shear rate (gamma) that follow different scaling behavior. In
	the first, the viscosity and first normal stress coefficient scale
	roughly as gamma(-6/11) and gamma(-14/11), respectively. At higher
	shear rates, these become gamma(-2/3) and gamma(-4/3). These regimes
	are found for both free-draining and HI models and can be understood
	based on scaling arguments for the diffusion of chain ends. (C) 2002

	In the variational treatment, the Coulomb potentials are emulated

	are used as variational parameters. The accuracy of the variational
	approach is tested against Monte Carlo data. Excellent agreement
	is obtained for the end-to-end separation and the apparent dissociation
	constant for the unscreened Coulomb chain. The short-range screened
	Coulomb potential is more difficult to handle variationally, and
	its structural features are less well described, although the thermodynamic
	properties are predicted with the same accuracy as for the unscreened
	chain. The number of variational parameters is on the order of N-2,
	where N is the number of monomers, and the computational effort scales
	like N-3. In addition, a simplified variational procedure with only
	two parameters is pursued, based on a rigid-rod approximation of

	a higher adhesion (pull-off force) when PAH was adsorbed in the outermost
	layers. There was also a difference depending on the molecular mass
	of the polymers, demonstrating a greater adhesion for the low molecular
	mass combination of polyelectrolytes. Furthermore, the time in contact
	showed to be of importance, with increasing pull-off forces with
	contact time at maximum load. The SFA measurements were conducted
	under dry conditions, at 100\% RH, and under wet conditions for PEMs
	adsorbed at pH 7.5/3.5. The SFA adhesion measurements showed that
	under dry conditions, the adhesive forces between two high energetic
	mica substrates were lowered when they were covered by PEMs before
	the measurements. The thickness of the adsorbed layers was also measured
	using SFA. This showed that there was a significant swelling when
	the dry layers were exposed to 100\% RH or to wet conditions. The
	swelling was higher, indicating a less rigid layer, when PAH was
	adsorbed in the outermost layer than when the PEM was capped with

	PSS, and poly(diallyldimethylammonium) with regularly interspersed
	layers of deuterated PSS. Annealing, by salt, of the fuzzy internal
	layering within this multilayer was followed using neutron reflectometry.
	A limited source diffusion model fit the data well and showed that
	polyelectrolyte migrates much more slowly within the bulk of a multilayer
	than at the surface. Enhanced surface mobility and a nonlinear increase
	in diffusion rate with salt concentration were explained by a salt
	doping model, where correlated short lengths of polyelectrolyte move
	by exchange with counterions (extrinsic charge) doped into the ultrathin
	film of polyelectrolyte complex on exposure to solutions of high
	ionic strength. },

	field for organic molecules and peptides are described. Parameters
	for both torsional and nonbonded energetics have been derived, while
	the bond stretching and angle bending parameters have been adopted
	mostly from the AMBER all-atom force field. The torsional parameters
	were determined by fitting to rotational energy profiles obtained
	from ab initio molecular orbital calculations at the RHF/6-31G*//RHF/6-31G*
	level for more than 50 organic molecules and ions. The quality of
	the fits was high with average errors for conformational energies
	of less than 0.2 kcal/mol. The force-field results for molecular
	structures are also demonstrated to closely match the ab initio predictions.
	The nonbonded parameters were developed in conjunction with Monte
	Carlo statistical mechanics simulations by computing thermodynamic
	and structural properties for 34 pure organic liquids including alkanes,
	alkenes, alcohols, ethers, acetals, thiols, sulfides, disulfides,
	aldehydes, ketones, and amides. Average errors in comparison with
	experimental data are 2% for heats of vaporization and densities.
	The Monte Carlo simulations included sampling all internal and intermolecular
	degrees of freedom. It is found that such non-polar and monofunctional
	systems do not show significant condensed-phase effects on internal
	energies in going from the gas phase to the pure liquids.},

	near the surface and with bulk properties as well as Monte Carlo
	simulations to explore equilibrium adsorption structures of the polymer.
	Systems with varying polymer contour length, polymer stiffness, and
	polymersurface interaction potential have been considered. Investigations
	have been made on polymer extensions perpendicular and parallel to
	the surface and also characterized the adsorbed state in terms of
	loops, tails, and trains. After a diffusion of the polymer to the
	vicinity of the surface, three succeeding phases were identified:
	distortion, attachment, and relaxation phase. In the distortion phase,
	the polymer starts to experience the potential of the surface and
	becomes elongated perpendicular to the surface. In the attachment
	phase, the polymer makes direct contact with the surface and becomes
	contracted perpendicular to the surface and starts to spread on the
	surface. Finally, in the extended relaxation phase, the polymer continues
	to spread on the surface. },

	for layer-by-layer (LbL) polyelectrolyte self-assembly. Polystyrene
	sulfonate (PSS) and polyallylamine hydrochloride (PAH) polyelectrolyte
	films were deposited onto planar substrates and colloidal particles.
	Film deposition was confirmed using quartz crystal microbalance and
	zeta potential measurements. Formamide was used as an alternative
	to the water-based working solvents commonly used for LbL self-assembly.
	Few LbL self-assembly studies using nonaqueous solvents have been
	reported. Most studies performed with nonaqueous solvents have required
	the addition of small volumes of water to dissolve the polyelectrolytes.
	Conversely, the high dielectric constant of pure formamide led to
	the dissolution and transport of PSS and PAH. Using formamide, it
	is possible to deposit nanometer thick polyelectrolyte films onto
	water-sensitive surfaces. Formamide can be thus be used for encapsulating
	water sensitive hydrogen storage materials within polyelectrolyte

  abstract = {We try to elucidate the microstructure formation in a monodisperse
	ferrofluid monolayer. The
	
	system under study consists of soft sphere magnetic dipolar particles
	confined to a thin fluid layer.
	
	The positions of the particles are constrained to a 2D geometry, whereas
	the particle magnetic
	
	dipole moments are not fixed to the body systems, and are free to
	rotate in 3 dimensions, hence
	
	forming in what we call a quasi-2D geometry. Using a combination of
	analytical density
	
	functional theory and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we find
	that for the studied range
	
	of parameters the majority of aggregates might be divided into two
	types: chains and rings. Their
	
	sizes and area fractions are strongly influenced by the geometrical
	constraints. We show that for
	
	quasi-2D systems the excluded area effects play one of the most important

	Coulombic interactions (Kawata, M., and Mikami, M., 2000, J. Comput.
	Chen., in press), the extension of this method to include van der
	Waals interactions yielded further acceleration of the overall MD
	calculation by a factor of about two. Compared with conventional

	Ewald method (timestep of 0.25 fs), the speedup by using the extended
	integrated method amounted to a factor of 500 for a 100 ps simulation.

	the atomic force
	
	microscope indicated similar force-distance profiles for the interaction
	between silicon nitride
	
	and mica. With this technique concentrations as high as 5 M can be
	investigated, and owing to
	
	the small radius of curvature much higher pressures can be recorded.
	Results obtained by both
	
	methods confirm that the force is strongly attractive at very small
	surface separations, in
	
	agreement with the theoretical predictions based on calculations of
	ion correlations. Just outside
	
	of that interval the interaction is repulsive, and it can be quantitatively
	explained by taking into
	
	account the adsorption of hydrated ions onto the surface (sign reversal
	of the effective surface
	
	charge) and the layering of co- and counter-ions. At larger surface
	separations, the behavior
	
	indicates a balance between the double layer repulsion and the van
	der Waals attraction (the
	
	presence of a secondary minimum).},

  abstract = {Abstract: Atomistic simulations are conducted to examine the dependence
	of the viscosity of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide
	on temperature and water content. A nonequilibrium molecular dynamics
	procedure is utilized along with an established fixed charge force
	field. It is found that the simulations quantitatively capture the
	temperature dependence of the viscosity as well as the drop in viscosity
	that occurs with increasing water content. Using mixture viscosity
	models, we show that the relative drop in viscosity with water content
	is actually less than that that would be predicted for an ideal system.
	This finding is at odds with the popular notion that small amounts
	of water cause an unusually large drop in the viscosity of ionic
	liquids. The simulations suggest that, due to preferential association
	of water with anions and the formation of water clusters, the excess
	molar volume is negative. This means that dissolved water is actually
	less effective at lowering the viscosity of these mixtures when compared
	to a solute obeying ideal mixing behavior. The use of a nonequilibrium
	simulation technique enables diffusive behavior to be observed on
	the time scale of the simulations, and standard equilibrium molecular
	dynamics resulted in sub-diffusive behavior even over 2 ns of simulation
	time.},

	PCB5 - within a polyelectrolyte multilayer film. Multilayer growth
	and ionization of carboxylic groups are monitored in situ using ATR-FTIR.
	Deposition of PCB5 within the film is contrasted for two pH regimes:
	(1) at slightly acidic pH values where PCB5 carries overall cationic
	charge, but a significant number of dipoles provided by ionized carboxylic
	groups also exists within the polymer chain, and (2) at neutral and
	basic pH values where these polymers become zwitterionic. In the
	latter case, no multilayers could be produced with either polyanions
	or polycations. In the former case, PCB5 can be deposited within
	the polymer film via alternating adsorption with a variety of polyanions,
	such as heparin, DNA, poly(carboxylic acid)s, or poly(styrenesulfonate).
	The produced films can be erased from the solid surface by exposure
	to solutions with higher pH values, when the fraction of charged
	carboxylic groups in PCB5 is increased. The presence of zwitterions
	in PCB5 chains allowed building hybrid layers which contained PCB5
	bound with both a polyanion and a polycation. In contrast to PCB5/polyanion
	films, hybrid films showed a stability region extended to neutral
	pH values and dissolved at both pH > 7 and pH < 4. The PCB5-containing
	films show promise for bioseparation and biotechnology applications
	when used as sacrificial layers or for controlled release of incorporated
	small molecules.}},

  abstract = {We use lattice Boltzmann simulations, in conjunction with Ewald summation
	methods, to investigate the role of hydrodynamic interactions in
	colloidal suspensions of dipolar particles, such as ferrofluids.
	Our work addresses volume fractions phi of up to 0.20 and dimensionless
	dipolar interaction parameters lambda of up to 8. We compare quantitatively
	with Brownian dynamics simulations, in which many-body hydrodynamic
	interactions are absent. Monte Carlo data are also used to check
	the accuracy of static properties measured with the lattice Boltzmann
	technique. At equilibrium, hydrodynamic interactions slow down both
	the long-time and the short-time decays of the intermediate scattering
	function S(q, t), for wavevectors close to the peak of the static
	structure factor S(q), by a factor of roughly two. The long-time
	slowing is diminished at high interaction strengths, whereas the
	short-time slowing (quantified via the hydrodynamic factor H(q))
	is less affected by the dipolar interactions, despite their strong
	effect on the pair distribution function arising from cluster formation.
	Cluster formation is also studied in transient data following a quench
	from lambda = 0; hydrodynamic interactions slow the formation rate,
	again by a factor of roughly two.},

  abstract = {We consider several dipolar fluids in their isotropic phase by integral
	equations in the reference hypernetted chain approximation, The systems
	differ in the form of the nondipolar potential. At low temperatures
	all of these fluids exhibit a spinodal line. Approaching this line
	from above, several fluctuations strongly increase. We interpret
	these fluctuations as indications for the low temperature states
	of the systems. In agreement with simulation results we find that
	the fluctuations at low densities strongly depend on the form of
	the nondipolar potential. In the dipolar hard sphere fluid we see
	a strong tendency that the particles associate into chainlike structures.
	Considering the same system with an additional Lennard-Jones attraction
	(Stockmayer fluid), we find that fluctuations of the number density
	which point to a usual condensation, clearly dominate. By switching
	off this isotropic attraction gradually, there is a smooth changeover
	from condensation to dipole clustering At higher densities the behavior
	of the fluctuations becomes independent of the nondipolar potential:
	now the fluctuations indicate a transition into a fluid state with
	long-ranged ferroelectric order. By minimizing a density functional
	which has direct correlation functions of the isotropic phase as
	an input, we find the corresponding coexistence lines, Only at very
	high densities do the fluctuations point to crystallization. (C)

  abstract = {This work builds a basis for understanding electrostatic and solvation
	forces between various types of helical molecules by explicitly incorporating
	the helical structure and symmetries into the theory. We derive exact
	expressions for interaction between molecules with cylindrical inner
	cores and arbitrary distribution of discrete surface charges and
	analyze forces between single-stranded, double-stranded, and multistranded
	helices. For example, we demonstrate that the traditional approximation
	by a homogeneously charged rod becomes inappropriate when even less
	than a third of the strand charge on a single-stranded helix is neutralized
	by countercharges (adsorbed or intrinsic to the helix by their nature).
	The traditionally expected force is then complemented by helix-specific
	interactions. These helix-specific forces allow commensurate helices
	(with the ratio of pitches equal to a rational number) to recognize
	each other at a distance and self-assemble into an aggregate. Under
	certain conditions, these forces may induce a spontaneous symmetry
	loss, e.g., two DNA-type double helices rotate around their long
	axes to a separation-dependent angle when the molecules come closer
	than a critical interaxial separation. In general, while a longer-range
	helix-specific attraction induces the self-assembly, a shorter-range
	helix-specific repulsion prevents the tight molecular contact creating
	a force balance responsible for a nonzero surface separation in equilibrium.
	The decay rates and the amplitudes of the attraction and of the repulsion
	depend on the helical pitch and on the number and relative disposition
	of the helical strands. The theory of these forces allows us to explain
	a number of puzzling features of interactions measured between biological
	helices, including DNA, collagen, and four-stranded guanosine macromolecules.},

	is modified and becomes an adsorption/dissolution process. The influence
	of different salts (phosphates, chlorides, and nitrates) and polyelectrolyte
	molecular weight on formation and erosion of multilayers on silica
	surfaces was investigated. In all experiments, the anionic polyelectrolyte
	was poly(acrylic acid). As the cationic polyelectrolyte, poly(dimethylaminoethyl
	methacrylate), poly(allylamine hydrochloride), and poly(2-vinyl-N-methylpyridinium
	iodide) were used. It has been shown that at very low ionic strength
	(1 mM) regular buildup of multilayers is observed independent of
	the salt used. However, at higher ionic strength, dissolution also
	takes place, and the critical glass-transition ionic strength needed
	for the multilayer to be dissolved depends on the salt used, as well

	to be non-equilibrium structures. Due to the strong attraction between
	oppositely charged polyions, polyelectrolyte interdiffusion is thought
	to be suppressed during the adsorption process. Equilibration is
	promoted by a decrease of the electrostatic attraction between polyion
	pairs. We have used neutral impact collision ion scattering spectroscopy
	to investigate the influence of polyelectrolyte multilayer annealing
	in water and aqueous 1 M NaCl solutions at different temperatures
	(20 and 70 degrees C) on the increase in interpenetration of a single
	polyelectrolyte layer throughout the whole film. The multilayers
	were composed of poly(4-vinylpyridinium) and poly(4-styrenesulfonate).
	Contrast between neighboring layers was established by labelling
	the layer in question with the heavy atom ruthenium. It is found
	that both temperature and salt increase layer interpenetration, whereas
	salt has a stronger influence than temperature. From numerical simulations
	polyelectrolyte diffusion coefficients were evaluated for the different
	annealing conditions. The influence of temperature and salt on the
	equilibration of the film is interpreted in terms of increased screening
	of polyion charges and binding of small counterions to polyion monomeric
	units.},

  abstract = {Molecular-dynamics simulations are used to study the effective interactions
	in charged stabilized colloidal suspensions. We focus on highly charged
	macroions in the limit of low salt concentrations. Within this regime,
	nonlinear corrections to Debye-Huckel (DH) theory have to be considered.
	For non-bulk-like systems, such as isolated pairs or triples of macroions,
	we show that nonlinear effects can become relevant, which cannot
	be described by the charge renormalization concept [S. Alexander
	, J. Chem. Phys. 80, 5776 (1984)]. For an isolated pair of macroions,
	we find an almost perfect qualitative agreement between our simulation
	data and DH theory. However, on a quantitative level, neither DH
	theory nor the charge renormalization concept can be confirmed in
	detail. This seems mainly to be related to the fact that for small
	ion concentrations, microionic layers can strongly overlap, whereas,
	simultaneously, excluded volume effects are less important. In the
	case of isolated triples, where we compare between coaxial and triangular
	geometries, we find attractive corrections to pairwise additivity
	in the limit of small macroion separations and salt concentrations.
	These triplet interactions arise if all three microionic layers around
	the macroions exhibit a significant overlap. In contrast to the case
	of two isolated colloids, the charge distribution around a macroion
	in a triple is found to be anisotropic.},

  abstract = {We have developed a simple and quantitative explanation for the relatively
	low melting temperatures of ionic liquids (ILs). The basic concept
	was to assess the Gibbs free energy of fusion (Delta(fus)G) for the
	process IL(s) --> IL(l), which relates to the melting point of the
	IL. This was done using a suitable Born-Fajans-Haber cycle that was
	closed by the lattice (i.e., IL(s) --> IL(g)) Gibbs energy and the
	solvation (i.e., IL(g) --> IL(l)) Gibbs energies of the constituent
	ions in the molten salt. As part of this project we synthesized and
	determined accurate melting points (by DSC) and dielectric constants
	(by dielectric spectroscopy) for 14 ionic liquids based on four common
	anions and nine common cations. Lattice free energies (Delta(latt)G)
	were estimated using a combination of Volume Based Thermodynamics
	(VBT) and quantum chemical calculations. Free energies of solvation
	(Delta(solv)G) of each ion in the bulk molten salt were calculated
	using the COSMO solvation model and the experimental dielectric constants.
	Under standard ambient conditions (298.15 K and 10(5) Pa) Delta(fus)G
	degrees was found to be negative for all the ILs studied, as expected
	for liquid samples. Thus, these ILs are liquid under standard ambient
	conditions because the liquid state is thermodynamically favorable,
	due to the large size and conformational flexibility of the ions
	involved, which leads to small lattice enthalpies and large entropy
	changes that favor melting. This model can be used to predict the
	melting temperatures and dielectric constants of ILs with good accuracy.
	A comparison of the predicted vs experimental melting points for
	nine of the ILs (excluding those where no melting transition was
	observed and two outliers that were not well described by the model)
	gave a standard error of the estimate (s(est)) of 8 degrees C. A
	similar comparison for dielectric constant predictions gave s(est)
	as 2.5 units. Thus, from very little experimental and computational
	data it is possible to predict fundamental properties such as melting
	points and dielectric constants of ionic liquids.},

	While CMM provides an efficient way of computing energy and forces

	remains a computational bottleneck in simulations of these systems.
	In this paper, we apply CMM (single-level) to substantially reduce
	the single-iteration time. We further reduce the single-iteration
	time using a refined CMM iterative algorithm. In addition, we introduce
	an iterative predictor scheme to reduce the number of iterations
	to self-consistency. We apply these algorithms to polarizable water
	using the polarizable SPC (PSPC) model. The "refined CMM/predictor"
	iterative algorithm is shown to be accurate and extremely efficient.

  abstract = {We report a strategy for encapsulating and condensing DNA. When T5
	phage binds to its membrane protein receptor, FhuA, its double stranded
	DNA (120,000 bp) is progressively released base pair after base pair
	in the surrounding medium. Using cryoelectron microscopy, we have
	visualized the structures formed after T5 phage DNA is released into
	neutral unilamellar proteoliposomes reconstituted with the receptor
	FhuA. In the presence of spermine, toroidal condensates of circumferentially
	wrapped DNA were formed. Most significantly, the sizes of these toroids
	were shown to vary, from 90 to 200 nm in their outer diameters, depending
	on the number of DNA stands transferred. We have also analyzed T5
	DNA release in bulk solution containing the detergent-solubilized
	FhuA receptor. After DNA release in a spermine containing solution,
	huge DNA condensates with a diameter of about 300 nm were formed
	containing the DNAs from as many as 10-20 capsids. At alkaline pH,
	the condensates appeared as large hollow cylinders with a diameter
	of 200 nm and a height of 100-200 nm. Overall, the striking feature
	of our experiments is that, because of the progressive release of
	DNA from the phage capsid, the mechanism of toroid formation is fundamentally
	different from that in the classical studies in which highly dilute,
	{"}naked{"} DNA is condensed by direct addition of polyvalent rations;
	as a consequence, our method leads to toroids of arbitrary size.},

	{A} random walk algorithm to produce a flat histogram},
  journal = {Physical Review E},
  year = {2001},
  volume = {64},
  pages = {056101},
  number = {5},
  abstract = {We describe an efficient Monte Carlo algorithm using a random walk
	in energy space to obtain a very accurate estimate of the density
	of states for classical statistical models. The density of states
	is modified at each step when the energy level is visited to produce
	a flat histogram. By carefully controlling the modification factor,
	we allow the density of states to converge to the true value very
	quickly, even for large systems. From the density of states at the
	end of the random walk, we can estimate thermodynamic quantities
	such as internal energy and specific heat capacity by calculating
	canonical averages at any temperature. Using this method, we not
	only can avoid repeating simulations at multiple temperatures, but
	we can also estimate the free energy and entropy, quantities that
	are not directly accessible by conventional Monte Carlo simulations.
	This algorithm is especially useful for complex systems with a rough
	landscape since all possible energy levels are visited with the same
	probability. As with the multicanonical Monte Carlo technique, our
	method overcomes the tunneling barrier between coexisting phases
	at first-order phase transitions, In this paper, we apply our algorithm
	to both first- and second-order phase transitions to demonstrate
	its efficiency and accuracy. We obtained direct simulational estimates
	for the density of states for two-dimensional ten-state Potts models
	on lattices up to 200x200 and Ising models on lattices up to 256x256.
	Our simulational results are compared to both exact solutions and
	existing numerical data obtained using other methods. Applying this
	approach to a three-dimensional +/-J spin-glass model, we estimate
	the internal energy and entropy at zero temperature; and, using a
	two-dimensional random walk in energy and order-parameter space,
	we obtain the (rough) canonical distribution and energy landscape
	in order-parameter space. Preliminary data suggest that the glass
	transition temperature is about 1.2 and that better estimates can
	be obtained with more extensive application of the method. This simulational
	method is not restricted to energy space and can be used to calculate
	the density of states for any parameter by a random walk in the corresponding
	space.},

  abstract = {The alternate deposition of polyanions and polycations leads to the
	formation of films called polyelectrolyte multilayer films (PEMs).
	Two types of growth processes are reported in the literature, leading
	to films that grow either linearly or exponentially with the number
	of deposition steps. In this article we try to establish a correlation
	between the nature of the growth process and the heat of complexation
	between the polyanions and the polycations constituting the PEM film.
	Isothermal titration microcalorimetry experiments performed on several
	polyanion/polycation systems seem to indicate that an endothermic
	complexation process is characteristic of an exponential film growth,
	whereas a strongly exothermic process corresponds to a linear growth
	regime. Finally, weakly exothermic processes seem to be associated
	with weakly exponentially growing films. These results thus show
	that exponentially growing processes are mainly driven by entropy.
	This explains why the exponential growth processes are more sensitive
	to temperature than the linear growing processes. This temperature
	sensitivity is shown on the poly-L-glutamic acid/poly(allylamine)
	system which grows either linearly or exponentially depending on
	the ionic strength of the polyelectrolyte solutions.},

	in the annealed A block depends on both the pH and the added 1:1
	electrolyte concentration s. Beyond the cmc, the diblock copolymers
	form either low aggregation number starlike or large aggregation
	number crew-cut micelles. A nonmonotonic behavior of the micellar
	properties as a function of s for fixed pH is found. For starlike
	micelles, the scaling of the aggregation number Nagg with s is in
	fair agreement with analytical predictions, i.e., Nagg s0.7-0.9.
	For the core radius, we find that Rcore s0.24-0.3, and for the corona
	thickness Tcorona s-0.08. For crew-cut micelles, the scaling exponents
	deviate significantly from analytical predictions. Upon increasing
	pH, a smooth transition from crew-cut to starlike micelles happens
	at high s. Interestingly, a coexistence between these two different
	micellar sizes is possible for relatively low values of s in a narrow
	pH range. The corresponding thermodynamics, phase diagram, and various
	structural properties are presented. },

  abstract = {The collapse kinetics of strongly charged polyelectrolytes in poor
	solvents is investigated by Langevin simulations and scaling arguments.
	We investigate the role of valence z of counterions, solvent quality,
	and shape of counterions on the dynamics of collapse. On the basis
	of the simulations, a number of results are obtained. (1) The rate
	of collapse, which is measured using the time dependence of the radius
	of gyration of the chain, increases sharply as z increases from 1
	to 4. The collapse is particularly slow for the monovalent case and
	is observed only when the solvent quality is sufficiently poor. (2)
	Although the routes to collapse depend on 2 and the solvent quality
	a general collapse mechanism emerges. Upon quenching to low temperatures,
	counterions condense rapidly on a diffusion-limited time scale. At
	intermediate times metastable pearl-necklace structures form. The
	clusters merge at longer times with the largest one growing at the
	expense of smaller ones which is reminiscent of the Lifshitz-Slyozov
	growth mechanism. (3) The structure of the globule is controlled
	by z and the solvent quality. The combined system of the collapsed
	chain and the condensed counterions forms a Wigner crystal when the
	solvent quality is not too poor provided E 1 2. For very poor solvents
	the morphology of the collapsed structure resembles a Wigner glass.
	These results are used to obtain a valence dependent diagram of states
	for strongly charged polyelectrolytes in poor solvents. (4) For a
	fixed z and quality of the solvent, the efficiency of collapse decreases
	dramatically as the size of the counterion increases. The shape of
	the counterions also affects the collapse dynamics. Spherical counterions
	are more efficient condensing agents than an isovalent cigar-shaped
	counterions.},

	developed and simulated via a Monte-Carlo-simulation, that successfully
	reproduces the phase behaviour of lipid bilayers.
	
	In particular, the model was able to reproduce the ripple phases of
	lipid bilayers, and thus to clarify the molecular structure of these
	phases, an unsolved problem since more than 30 years.},

	polarizability, and discrete channel charge sites have been much

	occur on the interior surfaces of certain nanopores, leading to intrinsic

	when the membrane surface is functionalized differently from the
	pore interior or when there are alternating dipolar/nondipolar stretches
	inside a long pore. The dipole-ion interaction is asymptotically
	unscreened by water, leading to ionic, charge segregated, insulating
	behavior that can block ion transport, and potentially novel current-voltage
	(I-V) characteristics.},

  abstract = {Colloidal suspensions are widely used to study processes such as melting,
	freezing(1-3) and glass transitions(4,5). This is because they display
	the same phase behaviour as atoms or molecules, with the nano- to
	micrometre size of the colloidal particles making it possible to
	observe them directly in real space(3,4). Another attractive feature
	is that different types of colloidal interactions, such as long-range
	repulsive(1,3), short-range attractive(5), hard-sphere-like(2-4)
	and dipolar(3), can be realized and give rise to equilibrium phases.
	However, spherically symmetric, long-range attractions ( that is,
	ionic interactions) have so far always resulted in irreversible colloidal
	aggregation(6). Here we show that the electrostatic interaction between
	oppositely charged particles can be tuned such that large ionic colloidal
	crystals form readily, with our theory and simulations confirming
	the stability of these structures. We find that in contrast to atomic
	systems, the stoichiometry of our colloidal crystals is not dictated
	by charge neutrality; this allows us to obtain a remarkable diversity
	of new binary structures. An external electric field melts the crystals,
	confirming that the constituent particles are indeed oppositely charged.
	Colloidal model systems can thus be used to study the phase behaviour
	of ionic species. We also expect that our approach to controlling
	opposite-charge interactions will facilitate the production of binary
	crystals of micrometre-sized particles, which could find use as advanced
	materials for photonic applications(7).},

	obtaining effective diffusivity and permeability of the solutes,

	model describing hydrogel behavior, based on multi-field effects,
	is developed to simulate the swelling and shrinking of these fascinating
	bio-materials, and it is termed the multi-effect-coupling pH-stimulus
	(MECpH) model. This model accounts for the ionic fluxes within both
	the hydrogel and solution, the coupling between the electric field,
	ionic fluxes, and mechanical deformations of the hydrogel. The main
	contribution of this model is to incorporate the relationship between
	the concentrations of the ionized fixed-charge groups and the diffusive
	hydrogen ion, which follows a Langmuir isotherm, into the PoissonNernstPlanck
	system. To validate this MECpH model, one-dimensional steady-state
	simulations under varying pH solution are carried out via a meshless
	HermiteCloud methodology, and the numerical results are compared
	with available experimental data. It is shown that the presently
	developed MECpH model is accurate, efficient, and numerically stable.

	to the prediction of the two-parameter renormalization-group theory.
	We critically reexamine this theory, and explain where the error
	lies. In an appendix, we prove rigorously (module some standard scaling

	of polymer concentrations covering both dilute and semidilute regime.
	Polyelectrolyte chains in dilute solutions are nonuniformly stretched
	with the projection of the linear monomer density onto the end-to-end
	vector increasing logarithmically from the middle of the chain. The
	simulation results for chain size dependence on the degree of polymerization
	at different polymer concentrations are in good qualitative agreement
	with predictions of the modified scaling model that takes into account
	nonuniform stretching of polyelectrolyte chains. In semidilute solutions
	we confirm that the correlation length is inversely proportional
	to the square root of polymer concentration. By measuring the bond
	angle correlation function, we have determined that polyelectrolyte
	chains can be viewed as flexible chains with the persistence length
	proportional to the correlation length. Our results for the concentration
	dependence of chain size Re on polymer concentration for the longest
	chains (N = 187 and N = 300) are approaching the power law c-1/4,
	predicted by the scaling model of salt-free polyelectrolyte solutions.},

  abstract = {We have developed a necklace model of hydrophobic polyelectrolytes
	in which the necklace structure consisting of polymeric globules
	(beads) connected by extended sections of the chain (strings of monomers)
	appears as a result of the counterion condensation and is caused
	by the balance of the correlation-induced attraction of condensed
	counterions to charged monomers and electrostatic repulsion between
	uncompensated charges. The size of the beads increases with polymer
	concentration while their number per chain decreases. We predict
	coexistence of necklaces with different number of beads on a polymer
	backbone at any polymer concentration. To test this necklace model,
	we performed molecular dynamics simulations of polyelectrolyte chains
	with degree of polymerization N varying from 25 to 373 and with fraction
	of charged monomers f ) 1/3, 1/2, and 1 in poor solvent conditions
	for polymer backbone. The observed concentration dependence of the
	bead size supports the assumption of the counterion condensation
	origin of the necklace structure. The overlap concentration is almost
	independent of the degree of polymerization for weakly charged chains
	(f ) 1/3). For strongly charged chains with f ) 1 the overlap concentration
	follows the normal N dependence observed for polyelectrolyte solutions
	in ! and good solvent regimes for polymer backbone. In semidilute
	solutions the correlation length of fully charged chains is inversely
	proportional to the square root of polymer concentration. The osmotic
	coefficient of the solutions of polyelectrolytes in poor solvent
	conditions for polymer backbone exhibits nonmonotonic concentration
	dependence in agreement with two-zone model predictions. It decreases
	with increasing polymer concentration in dilute solutions, while
	it is an increasing function of polymer concentration in the semidilute
	regime. The Kratky plot of the chain form factor is in excellent
	agreement with the neutron scattering experiments.},

  abstract = {The transport of microscopic particles such as growth factors, proteins,
	or drugs through the extracellular matrix (ECM) is based on diffusion,
	a ubiquitous mechanism in nature. The ECM shapes the local distribution
	of the transported macromolecules and at the same time constitutes
	an important barrier toward infectious agents. To fulfill these competing
	tasks, the hydrogels have to employ highly selective filtering mechanisms.
	Yet, the underlying microscopic principles are still an enigma in
	cell biology and drug delivery. Here, we show that the extracellular
	matrix presents an effective electrostatic bandpass, suppressing
	the diffusive motion of both positively and negatively charged objects.
	This mechanism allows uncharged particles to easily diffuse through
	the matrix, while charged particles are effectively trapped. However,
	by tuning the strength of this physical interaction of the particles
	with the biopolymer matrix, the microscopic mobility of formerly
	trapped particles can be rescued on demand. Moreover, we identify
	heparan sulfate chains to be one important key factor for the barrier
	function of the extracellular matrix. We propose that localized charge
	patches in the ECM are responsible for its highly unspecific but
	strongly selective filtering effect. Such localized interactions
	could also account for the observed tunability and selectivity of
	many other important permeability barriers that are established by
	biopolymer-based hydrogels, e.g., the mucus layer of endothelial
	cells or the hydrogel in the nuclear core complex.},

  pages = {3174 - 3180},
  abstract = {The double layer forces between spherical colloidal particles, accordingto
	the Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation, have been accurately calculated
	in the literature. The classical PB equation takes into account only
	the electrostatic interactions, which play a significant role incolloid
	science. However, there are at, and above, biological saltconcentrations
	other non-electrostatic ion specific forces acting that are ignored
	in such modelling. In this paper, the electrostatic potential profile
	and the concentration profile of co-ions and counterions near charged
	surfaces are calculated. These results are obtained by solving the
	classical PB equation and a modified PB equation in bispherical coordinates,
	taking into account the van der Waals dispersion interactions between
	the ions and both surfaces. Once the electrostatic potential is known
	we calculate the double layer force between two charged spheres.
	This is the first paper that solves the modified PB equation in bispherical
	coordinates. It is also the first time that the finite volume method
	is used to solve the PB equation in bispherical coordinates. This
	method divides the calculation domain into a certain number of sub-domains,
	where the physical law of conservation is valid, and can be readily
	implemented. The finite volume method is implemented for several
	geometries and when it is applied to solve PB equations presents
	low computational cost. The proposed method was validated by comparing
	the numerical results for the classical PB calculations with previous
	results reported in the literature. New numerical results using the
	modified PB equation successfully predicted the ion specificity commonly
	observed experimentally.},

	large-scale Brownian dynamics simulations, and show that it is in
	perfect agreement with the rigorous variational result D<D(K), and
	with Fixman's Green-Kubo formula, which is re-derived. This resolves
	the puzzle posed by earlier numerical results [Rey et al., Macromolecules
	24, 4666 (1991)], which rather seemed to indicate D>D(K); the older
	data are shown to have insufficient statistical accuracy to resolve
	this question. We then discuss the Green-Kubo integrand in some detail.
	This function behaves very differently for pre-averaged versus fluctuating
	hydrodynamics, as shown for the initial value by analytical considerations
	corroborated by numerical results. We also present further numerical
	data on the chain's statics and dynamics},

	allocated to each atom center by fitting the ab initio electrostatic
	potential. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed for eleven
	kinds of ILs that are comprised of NO3- anions and cyclic guanidinium-based
	cations. Validation was carried out by comparing our simulated densities
	with experimental and calculated data from the literature. Transport
	properties such as self-diffusion coefficients, viscosities, and
	conductivities were calculated by molecular dynamic simulation, and
	their dependence on the length of the alkyl chains of cyclic guanidinium-based
	cations are discussed. Radial distribution functions and spatial
	distribution functions were investigated to depict the microscopic
	structures of the ILs, and the relationship between their properties
	and microstructures is also discussed.},

	Polymers: A New Approach to Controlled Film Disruption and the Release

  journal = {Soft Matter},
  year = {2008},

  abstract = {We report an approach to the design of 'charge-shifting' anionic polymers
	that provides control over the disruption of ultrathin polyelectrolyte
	multilayers in aqueous media. We demonstrate that the addition of
	citraconic anhydride to poly(allylamine) yields an anionic, carboxylate-functionalized
	polymer (polymer 2) that can be converted readily back to cationic
	poly(allylamine) in acidic environments. The incorporation of polymer
	2 into polyelectrolyte multilayers thus provides an approach to the
	fabrication of films that are stable at neutral pH but that erode
	over a period of several days in acidic media (e.g., pH approximately
	5). Experiments using a structural analog of polymer 2 with carboxylate
	side chains that do not hydrolyze readily provided support for the
	view that the disruption of these films occurred as a result of polymer
	side chain hydrolysis and a resulting change in the net charge of
	the polymers. Because this approach is based upon the use of anionic
	polymers to induce film instability, it provides a platform for the
	design of multilayers that can be used to provide control over the
	release of cationic film components. As proof of concept, we demonstrated
	that ultrathin films approximately 100 nm thick fabricated using
	polymer 2 sustain the release of fluorescently labeled PAH for up
	to four days when incubated at pH 5.0. The synthetic approach used
	here is modular and tunable and can be used to introduce anionic
	'charge-shifting' character to a broad range of other polyamines.
	With further development, this approach could expand significantly
	the range of different cationic agents (e.g., cationic proteins,
	peptides, polymers, nanoparticles, etc.) that can be released or
	delivered from surfaces using polyelectrolyte multilayers.},

  abstract = {A new ''ab initio'' method is presented which is designed to simulate
	highly asymmetric systems of charged particles such as micellar solutions
	and charge-stabilized colloidal suspensions. The hybrid description
	considers the macroion degrees of freedom explicitly, while the microscopic
	counterions are treated within the framework of density functional
	theory. The counterion density profile is treated as a dynamical
	variable which is coupled to the macroion positions; the corresponding
	equation of motions are derived from a Lagrangian which contains
	a fictitious kinetic energy term associated with the inhomogeneous
	counterion density, with a fictitious mass chosen so that the counterions
	stay as close as possible to the surface of lowest free energy (adiabatic
	condition). The discontinuous behavior of the counterion density
	profile at the macroion surfaces is suppressed by the use of a classical
	pseudopotential scheme without spoiling the rapid variation of the
	counterion density profile outside the macroion cores. The ab initio
	method is implemented in Molecular and Brownian Dynamics simulations
	of concentrated colloidal suspensions, and the results are compared
	to the predictions of much simpler simulations based on the pairwise
	additive effective Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) potential
	between macroions. The density profiles calculated from the DLVO
	model differ considerably from the predictions of the ab initio simulations,
	but the macroion pair structures are in reasonable agreement. Recent
	''improvements'' of the standard DLVO theory are found to overestimate
	or underestimate the pair structure considerably. The density functional
	formalism may be used to derive systematic many-body corrections
	to the effective DLVO pair potential. The extension of the ab initio
	method to treat colloidal suspensions in the presence of added salt
	is briefly sketched.},

	the molecular simulation of ionic liquids, developed within the spirit
	of the OPLS-AA model and thus oriented toward the calculation of
	equilibrium thermodynamic and structural properties. The parameter
	sets reported here concern the cations alkylimidazolium, tetra-alkylphosphonium,
	and N-alkylpyridinium, and the anions chloride, bromide, and dicyanamide.
	The force field is built in a stepwise manner that allows the construction
	of models for an entire family of cations, with alkyl side chains
	of different length, for example. Due to the transferability of the
	present force field, the ions studied here can be combined with those
	reported in our two previous publications to create a large variety
	of ionic liquids that can be studied by molecular simulation. The
	parameters reported were obtained through different series of ab
	initio calculations concerning the geometry, force constants, torsion
	energy profiles, and electrostatic charge distributions of the ions
	under study. Validation of the force field consisted of comparison
	with experimental crystal structure and liquid density data.},

	bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide as the anions, [Cnmim][PF6] or
	[Cnmim][(CF3SO2)2N], respectively. They were represented, for the
	first time in a simulation study focusing on long-range structures,
	by an all-atom force field of the AMBER/OPLS_AA family containing
	parameters developed specifically for these compounds. For ionic
	liquids with alkyl side chains longer than or equal to C4, aggregation
	of the alkyl chains in nonpolar domains is observed. These domains
	permeate a tridimensional network of ionic channels formed by anions
	and by the imidazolium rings of the cations. The nanostructures can
	be visualized in a conspicuous way simply by color coding the two
	types of domains (in this work, we chose red = polar and green =
	nonpolar). As the length of the alkyl chain increases, the nonpolar
	domains become larger and more connected and cause swelling of the
	ionic network, in a manner analogous to systems exhibiting microphase
	separation. The consequences of these nanostructural features on
	the properties of the ionic liquids are analyzed.},

	of polystyrene copolymer spheres crystallize in a body-centred cubic
	structure. Interesting differences in the shape of the phase boundary
	are observed. In the first case a peaked increase of crystal stability
	was observed for a mixing ratio of p = 0.2-0.3, which gives the fraction
	of small spheres. Also in the second case the stability of the crystalline
	phase is larger than expected for an ideal solid solution but over
	a more extended range of small p. In addition at p = 0.7-0.8 we find
	a pronounced suppression of crystallization and furthermore some
	indications of a precipitation of one species at p = 0.9. While the
	first phase diagram resembles that of a solid solution with possibly
	the onset of compound formation, the second more resembles a eutectic.

	the formation of stable polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEMs) from cationic
	and anionic starches (with degrees of substitution of 0.04-0.09)
	on SiO2 surfaces, taking account of the effect of the charge density
	of the starches and the salt concentration in the surrounding water
	phase. The experiments were performed at a pH of 6.3 using stagnation
	point adsorption reflectometry (SPAR) and quartz crystal microbalance
	with dissipation (QCM-D). From these experiments it was concluded
	that it is possible to form PEMs by the adsorption of oppositely
	charged starches on SiO2 surfaces; it was also found that adsorption
	of the first layer is controlled both by electrostatic, non-ionic
	interactions and by pure steric restrictions, i.e. geometrical restrictions,
	at the surface. The results also indicate that the charge density
	of the starch must exceed a certain value to allow multilayer formation
	and that this critical charge density increases with increasing salt
	concentration. The combination of charge densities of the cationic/anionic
	starches was also found to influence the adsorption behaviour, and
	the formed polyelectrolyte multilayers had a high water content of
	69-92%.},

	water. We use molecular dynamics simulation to calculate different
	probability densities that govern the time evolution of the formation
	and rupture of hydrogen bonds. We provide analytical connections
	between these functions. Excellent agreement with our simulation
	results is observed. We prove transition state theory rate constant
	to be identical to the inverse of the associated mean first passage
	time (hydrogen bond lifetime). Hence, the analysis establishes its
	Arrhenius temperature dependence. We give the explicit relation between
	reactive flux correlation function for the relaxation dynamics of
	hydrogen bonds, and their first passage time probability densities.
	All the different observations in the existing literature, associated
	with various estimates of hydrogen bonding times in liquid water
	that are affected (or not affected) by particular bond criteria,
	as well as by different definitions of hydrogen bond lifetimes applied
	in simulation, can be easily reconciled within the framework of reactive
	flux correlation function approach.},

	to separation. Ion pairs with the same charge are also stabilised
	by solvent screening due to induced polarisation of the solvent.
	In both cases screening is essentially complete outside the first
	shell, but is large even when there is no solvent between the ions.
	Charge distributions in the solvation shells around ion pairs are
	shown and the results interpreted with the aid of a simple model
	of two ions in an spheroidal cavity in a conducting medium. The actual
	or Madelung potential experienced by the second solute ion is found

	found in the Poisson potential around a single solute ion. We conclude

	the solvent strength, characterized by the relative deviation from
	the Theta point, tau, and the fraction of charged monomers in the
	chain, which is effectively tuned by varying the Coulomb interaction
	parameter. The conformations are discussed in terms of global properties
	(such as the end-to-end distance, the inertia tensor components,
	etc.) and functions revealing more detailed information, such as
	the density distribution around the center of mass and the structure
	factor. For chains in the Theta regime our data confirm the picture
	of a string of electrostatic blobs. For poorer solvents (up to tau
	= 0.4) we observe, upon increasing the intrachain Coulomb repulsion,
	a splitting of the spherical globule into a dumbbell-type structure,
	accompanied by a sharp increase in the chain's gyration radius. For
	sufficiently large tau, a further splitting is observed as well.
	Such a necklace globule (a sequence of transitions) had been predicted
	by Dobrynin, Rubinstein and Obukhov (Macromolecules 1996, 39, 2974),
	with a nontrivial scaling of the gyration radius with chain length
	and interaction parameters, which is confirmed by our data. By means
	of a scaling analysis, we argue that the transitions can be interpreted
	as thermodynamic first-order phase transformations, when taking the
	appropriate thermodynamic limit, which implies a scaling of the electrostatic
	coupling with inverse chain length.},

  abstract = {Abstract: New protein parameters are reported for the all-atom empirical
	energy function in the CHARMM program. The parameter evaluation was
	based on a self-consistent approach designed to achieve a balance
	between the internal (bonding) and interaction (nonbonding) terms
	of the force field and among the solvent-solvent, solvent-solute,
	and solute-solute interactions. Optimization of the internal parameters
	used experimental gas-phase geometries, vibrational spectra, and
	torsional energy surfaces supplemented with ab initio results. The
	peptide backbone bonding parameters were optimized with respect to
	data for N-methylacetamide and the alanine dipeptide. The interaction
	parameters, particularly the atomic charges, were determined by fitting
	ab initio interaction energies and geometries of complexes between
	water and model compounds that represented the backbone and the various
	side chains. In addition, dipole moments, experimental heats and
	free energies of vaporization, solvation and sublimation, molecular
	volumes, and crystal pressures and structures were used in the optimization.
	The resulting protein parameters were tested by applying them to
	noncyclic tripeptide crystals, cyclic peptide crystals, and the proteins
	crambin, bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, and carbonmonoxy myoglobin
	in vacuo and in crystals. A detailed analysis of the relationship
	between the alanine dipeptide potential energy surface and calculated
	protein , angles was made and used in optimizing the peptide group
	torsional parameters. The results demonstrate that use of ab initio
	structural and energetic data by themselves are not sufficient to
	obtain an adequate backbone representation for peptides and proteins
	in solution and in crystals. Extensive comparisons between molecular
	dynamics simulations and experimental data for polypeptides and proteins
	were performed for both structural and dynamic properties. Energy
	minimization and dynamics simulations for crystals demonstrate that
	the latter are needed to obtain meaningful comparisons with experimental
	crystal structures. The presented parameters, in combination with
	the previously published CHARMM all-atom parameters for nucleic acids
	and lipids, provide a consistent set for condensed-phase simulations
	of a wide variety of molecules of biological interest.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we overview the GRAPE (GRAvity piPE) project to develop
	and use special-purpose computers for astrophysical many-body simulations.First,
	we discuss the trends in semiconductor technology and computer architecture,
	and discuss merits and demerits of special-purpose computers. The
	main advantage of the special-purpose systems is the possibility
	to utilize a much higher fraction of available silicon to actually
	do calculations. Most of the silicon on general-purpose microprocessors
	are now used for control logics and cache, in other words, to assure
	the generality. As an example, we describe our GRAPE project. In
	astrophysical many-body simulations, practically all computer time
	is spent to evaluate particle-particle interactions. This is because
	the gravitational interaction between astrophysical bodies is a long-range
	interaction and we cannot apply a cutoff. The basic idea behind the
	GRAPE project is let the special-purpose computer perform only the
	evaluation of the particle-particle interaction. All the rest of
	the calculation, such as the time integration of the orbits of particles,
	I/O, and diagnostics are handled by a general-purpose host computer.
	This partitioning has many important advantages, such as the ease
	of the development of the hardware, the flexibility of the overall
	system and long lifetime of the system. The newest machine, GRAPE-6,
	which will be completed soon, will provide the peak speed exceeding
	100 Tflops, for the development cost of less than 5 M dollars. (C)

  abstract = {Previous analysis of an elastic model of the nucleosome indicated
	that 10 bp end segments of DNA can exist in a continuum of mechanically
	stable trajectories ranging from complete winding on the histone
	octamer to complete unwinding. Stable states of 20 bp and 40 bp end
	segments, however, are grouped in bands separated by gaps where DNA
	trajectories are unstable. We extend these results to cover the entire
	range up to a complete nucleosomal turn, 80 bp. We find that 10 to
	60 bp segments have states intermediate between fully wound and fully
	unwound that are mechanically stable. In striking contrast, there
	is no stable intermediate trajectory for 70 bp or 80 bp segments.
	Segments of these lengths constitute a two-state system. A 70 or
	80 bp segment is either fully wound or fully unwound, and the population
	of these states is governed by Boltzmann's thermal distribution We
	have found a plausible dissociation pathway from the fully wound
	to the fully unwound state for the 80 bp segment. In a ponderous
	breathing motion that breaks all contacts with the histone surface,
	the segment climbs to an activation peak of about 12 kcal/mol, then
	rapidly straightens away from the histone core to complete dissociation.

	role in the description of the electrical double layer of colloidal

	leads to quite different results with respect to the classical treatment
	(where ions are assumed to be points). In particular, these discrepancies
	become more noticeable for highly charged particles in the presence
	of moderate or highly multivalent counterion concentrations. Moreover,
	it can be shown that the existence of an electrolyte mixture consisting
	of multi-~and monovalent counterions may cause that system to become
	overcharged, a feature that cannot be predicted from a classical
	point of view based on the Boltzmann distribution function. Precisely
	this aspect has recently produced an enormous interest in the field
	of biophysics since small variations in the physiological conditions
	of biocolloidal systems (e.g.~the addition of a multivalent salt)
	can induce important changes in their behaviour. In order to determine
	the relevance of ion correlations in electrolyte mixtures, we present
	some experimental results on the electrophoretic mobility of latex
	particles in the presence of different 1:1 and 3:1 salt mixtures.
	Likewise, these results are analysed within the so-called hypernetted-chain/mean
	spherical approximation where ion size correlations are taken into

  abstract = {Several theories (developed in the context of the so-called primitive
	models) argue that the classical Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) approach
	could fail to describe the electrical double layer in the case of
	high surface charge densities and/or ionic strengths. Under such
	conditions, the concentration of counterions in the vicinity of the
	surface would be larger than expected. What is more, the particle
	charge could be overcompensated (which is known as overcharging).
	This would lead to a considerable reduction in the magnitude of the
	[zeta]-potential (as compared with PB predictions) and, even, a reversal
	in its sign. Although these predictions are quite remarkable, these
	new approaches have been applied just scarcely in practice. Obviously,
	electrophoresis offers an excellent possibility of testing these
	theories. Accordingly, we have measured the electrophoretic mobility
	for latex particles with moderate and large surface charge densities
	at high ionic strengths. A commercial setup specifically designed
	for measuring extremely low mobilities has been used. The results
	have been interpreted with the help of the so-called hyper-netted-chain/mean-spherical
	approximation (HNC/MSA), a theory that includes ion size effects.
	In this way, overcharging has been experimentally investigated. Although
	the HNC/MSA is not a completely successful approach, our analysis
	suggests that the role of ion size correlations is important, particularly
	in electrolytes with a counterion valency of 2 or greater.},

  abstract = {Literature estimates of the melting curve of the Lennard-Jones system
	vary by as much as 10%. The origin of such discrepancies remains
	unclear. We present precise values for the Lennard-Jones melting
	temperature, and we examine possible sources of systematic errors
	in the prediction of melting points, including finite-size and interaction-cutoff
	effects. A hypothetical thermodynamic integration path is used to
	find the relative free energies of the solid and liquid phases, for
	various system sizes, at constant cutoff radius. The solid-liquid
	relative free energy and melting temperature scale linearly as the
	inverse of the number of particles, and it is shown that finite-size
	effects can account for deviations in the melting temperature (from
	the infinite-size limit) of up to 5%. An extended-ensemble density-of-states
	method is used to determine free energy changes for each phase as
	a continuous function of the cutoff radius. The resulting melting
	temperature predictions exhibit an oscillatory behavior as the cutoff
	radius is increased. Deviations in the melting temperature (from
	the full potential limit) arising from a finite cutoff radius are
	shown to be of comparable magnitude as those resulting from finite-size
	effects. This method is used to identify melting temperatures at
	five different pressures, for the infinite-size and full potential
	Lennard-Jones system. We use our simulation results as references
	to connect the Lennard-Jones solid equation of state of van der Hoef
	with the Lennard-Jones fluid equation of state of Johnson. Once the
	references are applied the two equations of state are used to identify
	a melting curve. An empirical equation that fits this melting curve
	is provided. We also report a reduced triple point temperatureTtr=0.694.},

	and spermidine to plasmid DNA was studied by isothermal titration
	calorimetry. Two stages were observed in the course of titration,
	the first attributed to cation binding and the second to DNA condensation.
	A standard calorimetric data analysis was extended by applying an
	electrostatic binding model, which accounted for most of the observed
	data. Both the binding and condensation reactions were entropically
	driven (T Delta S similar to + 10 kcal/mol cation) and enthalpically
	opposed (Delta H similar to + 1 kcal/mol cation). As predicted from
	their relative sizes, the binding constants of the cations were indistinguishable,
	but cobalt hexammine had a much greater DNA condensing capacity because
	it is more compact than spermidine. The dependence of both the free
	energy of cobalt hexammine binding and the critical. cobalt hexammine
	concentration for DNA condensation on temperature and monovalent
	cation concentration followed the electrostatic model quite precisely.
	The heat capacity changes of both stages were positive, perhaps reflecting
	both the temperature dependence of the dielectric constant of water
	and the burial of polar surfaces. DNA condensation occurred when
	about 67 percent of the DNA phosphate charge was neutralized by cobalt
	hexammine and 87 percent by spermidine. During condensation, the
	remaining DNA charge was neutralized.},

	uncharged polymer sample can be analyzed using free-solution capillary
	electrophoresis of DNA-polymer conjugates. In these conjugates, the
	DNA is providing the electromotive force while the uncharged polydisperse
	polymer chains of the sample retard the DNA engine with different
	amounts of hydrodynamic drag. Here we present a theoretical model
	of this new analytical method. We show that for the most favourable,
	diffusion-limited electrophoresis conditions, there is actually an
	optimal DNA size to achieve the separation of a given polymer sample.
	Moreover, we demonstrate that the effective friction coefficient
	of the polymer chains is related to the stiffness of the two polymers
	of the conjugate, thus offering a method to estimate the persistence
	length of the uncharged polymer through mobility measurements. Finally,
	we compare some of our predictions with available experimental results.},

	to separate charged-uncharged polymer conjugates have proven successful:
	end-labeled free-solution electrophoresis (ELFSE) for DNA sequencing,
	and free-solution conjugate electrophoresis (FSCE) for molar mass
	profiling of uncharged polymers. The approach taken to analyze the

	(Long, D., Dobrynin, A. V., Rubinstein, M., Ajdari, A., J. Chem.
	Phys. 1998, 108, 1234-1244) for the electrophoresis of molecules

	the ends of the polymers play a large role in determining the polymer's
	overall mobility; however, this aspect of the theory was neglected
	in previous work. Until now this "end effect" has, to the knowledge
	of the authors, not been recognized in experimental data. Through
	a careful investigation of the predicted end effect and a reanalysis
	of the experimental data, we demonstrate that indeed this effect
	critically impacts on the behavior of charged-uncharged polymer conjugates

  abstract = {DNA is a free-draining polymer. This subtle but "unfortunate" property
	of highly charged polyelectrolytes makes it impossible to separate
	nucleic acids by free-flow electrophoresis. This is why one must
	typically use a sieving matrix, such as a gel or an entangled polymer
	solution, in order to obtain some electrophoretic size separation.
	An alternative approach consists of breaking the charge to friction
	balance of free-draining DNA molecules. This can be achieved by labeling
	the DNA with a large, uncharged molecule (essentially a hydrodynamic
	parachute, which we also call a drag-tag) prior to electrophoresis;
	the resulting methodology is called end-labeled free-solution electrophoresis
	(ELFSE). In this article, we review the development of ELFSE over
	the last decade. In particular, we examine the theoretical concepts
	used to predict the ultimate performance of ELFSE for single-stranded
	(ssDNA) sequencing, the experimental results showing that ELFSE can
	indeed overcome the free-draining issue raised above, and the technological
	advances that are needed to speed the development of competitive
	ELFSE-based sequencing and separation technologies. Finally, we also
	review the reverse process, called free-solution conjugate electrophoresis
	(FSCE), wherein uncharged polymers of different sizes can be analyzed
	using a short DNA molecule as an electrophoretic engine.},

  abstract = {In end-labeled free-solution electrophoresis (ELFSE), DNA molecules
	are labeled with a frictional modifier or "drag-tag", allowing their
	size-based electrophoretic separation in free solution. Among the
	interesting observations from early work with dsDNA using streptavidin
	as a drag-tag was that the drag induced by including a streptavidin
	label at both ends was significantly more than double that from a
	single streptavidin (Heller, C. et al., J. Chromatogr A 1998, 806,
	113-121). This finding was assumed to be in error, and subsequent
	work focused on experiments in which only a single drag-tag is appended
	to one end of the DNA molecule. Recent theoretical work (McCormick,
	L. C., Slater, G. W., Electrophoresis 2005, 26,1659-1667) has examined
	the contribution of end-effects to the free-solution electrophoretic
	mobility of charged-uncharged polymer conjugates, reopening the question
	of enhanced drag from placing a drag-tag at both ends. In this study,
	this effect is investigated experimentally, using custom-synthesized
	ssDNA oligonucleotides allowing the attachment of drag-tags to one
	or both ends, as well as dsDNA PCR products generated with primers
	appropriate for the attachment of drag-tags at one or both ends.
	A range of sizes of drag-tags are used, including synthetic polypeptoid
	drag-tags as well as genetically engineered protein polymer drag-tags.
	The enhanced drag arising from labeling both ends has been confirmed,
	with 6-9\% additional drag for the ssDNA and 10-23\% additional drag
	for the dsDNA arising from labeling both ends than would be expected
	from simply doubling the size of the drag-tag at one end. The experimental
	results for ssDNA labeled at both ends are compared to the predictions
	of the recent theory of end-effects, with reasonably good quantitative
	agreement. These experimental findings demonstrate the feasibility
	of enhancing ELFSE separations by labeling both ends of the DNA molecule,
	leading to greater resolving power and a wider range of applications

  abstract = {{Polyelectrolyte multilayers can be used to design films which respond
	to mechanical stimuli. The behaviors of three different polyelectrolyte
	multilayers deposited onto silicone sheets were investigated: PAH/PSS,
	PDADMA/PSS and PLL/HA films {[}PAH: poly(allylamine); PSS: poly(styrene
	sulfonate); PDADMA: poly(diallyldimethylammonium); PLL: poly(L- lysine);
	HA: hyaluronic acid]. While (PLL/HA) and (PDADMA/PSS) multilayers
	remain undamaged under stretch, (PAH/PSS) films are very brittle
	and cracks are formed for low elongation degrees. PAH/PSS films behave
	more like glasses whereas (PLL/HA) and (PDADMA/PSS) multilayers behave
	rather as gels. (PSS/PAH) and (PSS/PDADMA) multilayers were also
	deposited as a capping and impermeable layer on top of a (PLL/HA)(30)
	multilayer acting as a compartment. Whereas (PSS/PAH) barriers exhibit
	large micrometric cracks under stretch, (PSS/PDADMA) barriers open
	through nanopore formation for a given stretching degree. When these
	films are brought back to the non-stretched state, the nanopores
	close and the barrier becomes tight again. In the case of (PSS/PAH)
	barriers, only a partial tightening is achieved.}},

	macromolecules threading through a very narrow pore in a very thin
	rigid membrane are presented, assuming at the cis side of the membrane

	is attractive. Two choices of monomer-wall attraction are considered,
	one choice is slightly below and the other slightly above the "mushroom
	to pancake" adsorption threshold c for an infinitely long chain.
	Studying chain lengths N = 32, 64, 128, and 256 and varying the number
	of monomers Ntrans (time t = 0) that have already passed the pore
	when the simulation started, over a wide range, we find for <c (nonadsorbing
	case) that the translocation probability varies proportional to ctrans
	= Ntrans(t = 0)/N for small ctrans, while for >c a finite number
	Ntrans(t = 0) suffices that the translocation probability is close
	to unity. In the case <c, however, the time it takes for those chains
	to get through the pore to complete the translocation process scales
	as N2.23?0.04. This result agrees with the suggestion of Chuang,
	Kantor, and Kardar [Phys. Rev. E 65, 011802 (2001)] that the translocation
	time is proportional to the Rouse time, that scales under good solvent
	condition as RouseN2+ 1, with the excluded-volume exponent 0.59 in
	d = 3 dimensions. Our results hence disagree with the suggestions
	that the translocation time should scale as either N2 or N3. For
	>c, we find that the translocation time scales as N1.65?0.08. We
	suggest a tentative scaling explanation for this result. Also the
	distribution of translocation times is obtained and discussed.},

	The effects of added simple electrolyte (sodium nitrate) upon the
	polymer adsorption/depletion behavior were also explored. The measured
	forces indicate that in the absence of added electrolyte, sodium
	polyacrylate molecules deplete from the silica-water interface at
	pH 7, leading to an attractive depletion force at close approach
	of the surfaces and weak liquidlike structural force oscillations
	at larger surface separations. These oscillations have a scaling
	length approximately proportional to c(p)(-0.50), which was independent
	of polymer molecular weight and in good agreement with the predictions
	of both scaling theory and computer simulation studies. The depletion
	layer thickness scaled according to c(p)(-0.6). In 1 x 10(-4) M NaNO3
	solution, the observed forces where similar to those in the absence

	concentrations the force curves indicated polymer adsorption. Adsorption
	occurred at a lower polymer concentration for the higher molecular

	oscillations vanished as the polymer solution became homogeneous

  abstract = {There are many atomic scale systems in materials, chemistry, and biology
	that can be effectively modeled as finite in two of the physical
	spatial dimensions and periodically replicated in the third including
	nanoscale metallic and semiconducting wires, carbon nanotubes, and
	DNA. However, it is difficult to design techniques to treat long
	range forces in these systems without truncation or recourse to slowly
	convergent supercells or computationally inefficient Poisson solvers.
	In this paper, a rigorous reciprocal space based formalism which
	permits long range forces on wires to be evaluated simply and easily
	via a small modification of existing methods for three dimensional
	periodicity is derived. The formalism is applied to determine long
	range interactions both between point particles using an Ewald-like
	approach and the continuous charge distributions that appear in electronic
	structure calculations. In this way, both empirical force field calculations
	and, for example, plane-wave based density functional theory computations
	on wires can be performed easily. The methodology is tested on model
	and realistic systems including a lithium doped carbon nanotube.

  abstract = {Surface functionalization with polyelectrolyte multilayer films (PEM
	films) has become very popular owing to its simplicity and versatility
	However, even if some research is already available, this field of
	surface chemistry lacks a systematic knowledge of how the polyelectrolyte
	structure and solution conditions influence the growth of PEM films
	In this investigation, we focus on the possible relationship between
	turbidity of polycation and polyanion mixtures in solution, and the
	buildup of PEM films made from the same polyelectrolytes in the same
	physicochemical conditions, namely pH, temperature and ionic strength
	It comes out that for six different polycation/polyanion combinations
	there is a clear correlation between the turbidity evolution of polycation/polyanion
	complexes with the salt concentration and the evolution of the film
	deposition with the same parameter. In this investigation, the complexes
	in solution were prepared in conditions where the ratio between the
	number of cationic to anionic groups was close to unity Even if there
	is a correlation between turbidity in solution and PEM film deposition.

  year = {2002},
  volume = {8},

  number = {1},
  abstract = {Using Monte Carlo simulations, we study the counterion distribution
	close to planar charged walls in two geometries: i) when only one
	charged wall is present and the counterions are confined to one half-space,
	and ii) when the counterions are confined between two equally charged
	walls. In both cases the surface charge is smeared out and the dielectric
	constant is the same everywhere. We obtain the counterion density
	profile and compare it with both the Poisson-Boltzmann theory (asymptotically
	exact in the limit of weak coupling, i.e. low surface charge, high
	temperature and low counterion valence) and the strong-coupling theory
	(valid in the opposite limit of high surface charge, low temperature
	and high counterion valence) and with previously calculated correction
	terms to both theories for different values of the coupling parameter,
	thereby establishing the domain of validity of the asymptotic limits.
	Gaussian corrections to the leading Poisson-Boltzmann behavior (obtained
	via a systematic loop expansion) in general perform quite poorly:
	At coupling strengths low enough so that the Gaussian (or one-loop)
	correction does describe the numerical deviations from the Poisson-Boltzmann
	result correctly, the leading Poisson-Boltzmann term by itself matches
	the data within high accuracy. This reflects the slow convergence
	of the loop expansion. For a single charged plane, the counterion
	pair correlation function indicates a behavioral change from a three-dimensional,
	weakly correlated counterion distribution (at low coupling) to a
	two-dimensional, strongly correlated counterion distribution (at
	high coupling), which is paralleled by the specific-heat capacity
	which displays a rounded hump at intermediate coupling strengths.
	For the case of counterions confined between two equally charged
	walls, we analyze the inter-wall pressure and establish the complete
	phase diagram, featuring attraction between the walls for large enough
	coupling strength and at intermediate wall separation. Depending
	on the thermodynamic ensemble, the phase diagram exhibits a discontinuous
	transition where the inter-wall distance jumps to infinity (hi the
	absence of a chemical potential coupling to the inter-wall distance,
	as for charged lamellae in excess solvent) or a critical point where
	two coexisting states with different inter-wall distance become indistinguishable
	(in the presence of a chemical potential, as for charged lamellae
	with a finite fixed solvent fraction). The attractive pressure decays
	with the inter-wall distance as an inverse cube, similar to analytic
	predictions, although the amplitude differs by an order of magnitude
	from previous theoretical results. Finally, we discuss in detail
	our simulation methods and compare the finite-size scaling behavior
	of different boundary conditions (periodic, minimal image and open).},

	of polyelectrolyte multilayers made from poly(diallyldimethylammonium
	chloride) (PDADMAC) and poly(styrenesulfonate) (PSS) by measuring
	the stiffness of individual hollow polyelectrolyte multilayer capsules
	in water using AFM force spectroscopy. Statistical analysis of the
	deformation data of the capsule ensemble combined with continuum
	mechanical modeling allows quantifying changes in the deformation
	characteristics and respective changes in the Young's modulus of
	the wall material. Our results show that the Young's modulus of the
	wall material decreases from the regime of 100 MPa to the order of
	MPa above 35 degrees C. This transition is reversible when returning
	to room temperature. The modulus becomes dependent on the deformation
	rate for high temperature, while it is not rate-dependent for low
	temperature. Therefore, we conclude that the wall material undergoes
	a melting process from a glassy to a viscoelastic fluid state. At
	the same time, a shrinking of the capsules is observed, which we
	explain qualitatively with surface tension effects. We discuss the
	implications of this finding in comparison with other multilayer
	systems and discuss novel strategies for shape control in PE multilayer
	systems based on these effects.},

  abstract = {In this review, we focus on four current related issues in multiscale
	modeling of soft and biological matter. First, we discuss how to
	use structural information from detailed models (or experiments)
	to construct coarse-grained ones in a hierarchical and systematic
	way. This is discussed in the context of the so-called Henderson
	theorem and the inverse Monte Carlo method of Lyubartsev and Laaksonen.
	In the second part, we take a different look at coarse graining by
	analyzing conformations of molecules. This is done by the application
	of self-organizing maps, i.e., a neural network type approach. Such
	an approach can be used to guide the selection of the relevant degrees
	of freedom. Then, we discuss technical issues related to the popular
	dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) method. Importantly, the potentials
	derived using the inverse Monte Carlo method can be used together
	with the DPD thermostat. In the final part we focus on solvent-free
	modeling which offers a different route to coarse graining by integrating
	out the degrees of freedom associated with solvent.},

	Both types of interactions give rise to memory effects, which lead
	to a slower and non-exponential decay of S(q, t), and which cause
	D-s(L) to be smaller than the short-time self-diffusion coefficient
	D-s(S). A global measure of the non-exponential decay of S(q, t)
	is the non-exponentiality factor Delta(q), which can be determined
	experimentally by dynamic light scattering. We derive microscopic
	expressions for the one-particle irreducible memory functions associated
	with Delta(q) and D-s(L), based on the generalized Smoluchowski equation
	and on a projection operator method developed recently by Kawasaki.
	HI are accounted for by a far-field expansion of the two-body hydrodynamic
	mobility tensors, by including the leading terms. We calculate Delta(q)
	and D-s(L) by constructing a novel mode-coupling approximation scheme
	which accounts for HI, and we extend the theory to moderately polydisperse
	suspensions. Our results for the measurable non-exponentiality factor

	charge-stabilized colloids is to reduce the non-exponentiality of

  abstract = {The interlacing technique of Hockney and Eastwood is extended to the
	particle-particle, particle-mesh (P3M) algorithm with analytical
	and ik-differentiation that computes the approximate Coulomb forces
	between N point particles in a periodic box. Interlacing means that
	one makes two separate computations of the reciprocal-space Ewald
	force, using two grids shifted with respect to each other by half
	of the diagonal of the grid subcell, and then takes the average of
	the two forces. The resulting algorithms compare favorably against
	their own noninterlaced versions and against the interlaced smooth
	particle-mesh Ewald algorithm. In our tests, the accuracy of the
	interlaced P3M methods was usually more than an order of magnitude
	higher than that of the other particle-mesh algorithms with the same
	parameter values. This accuracy gain can be converted into a speedup
	if the parameters of the algorithm are changed. Interlacing allows
	one to increase the grid spacing by up to a factor of 2 while keeping
	the same accuracy. A priori error estimates for the new algorithms
	are constructed, and the removal of the spurious self-force term
	is discussed. The success of interlacing is shown to be due to the
	fact that it suppresses the aliasing effects in the forces. It should
	be easy to incorporate the interlaced P3M algorithms into an existing
	simulation package, since this only requires a minor modification
	of the particle-mesh Ewald part of the code.},

	properties due to their flexibility and internal degrees of freedom,

	concepts and features that are relevant to the adsorption of neutral
	and charged polymers at equilibrium, including the type of polymer/surface
	interaction, the solvent quality, the characteristics of the surface,
	and the polymer structure. We pay special attention to the case of
	charged polymers (polyelectrolytes) that have a special importance
	due to their water solubility. We present a summary of recent progress
	in this rapidly evolving field. Because many experimental studies
	are performed with rather stiff biopolymers, we discuss in detail
	the case of semi-flexible polymers in addition to flexible ones.
	We first review the behavior of neutral and charged chains in solution.
	Then, the adsorption of a single polymer chain is considered. Next,
	the adsorption and depletion processes in the many-chain case are
	reviewed. Profiles, changes in the surface tension and polymer surface
	excess are presented. Mean-field and corrections due to fluctuations
	and lateral correlations are discussed. The force of interaction
	between two adsorbed layers, which is important in understanding
	colloidal stability, is characterized. The behavior of grafted polymers
	is also reviewed, both for neutral and charged polymer brushes. (C)

  abstract = {Variational methods are applied to a single polyelectrolyte chain.
	The polymer is modeled as a Gaussian chain with screened electrostatic
	repulsion between all monomers. As a variational Hamiltonian, the
	most general Gaussian kernel, including the possibility of a classical
	or mean polymer path, is employed. The resulting self-consistent
	equations are systematically solved both for large and small monomer-monomer
	separations along the chain. In the absence of screening, the polymer
	is stretched on average. It is described by a straight classical
	path with Gaussian fluctuations around it. If the electrostatic repulsion
	is screened, the polymer is isotropically swollen for large separations,
	and for small separations the polymer correlation function is calculated
	as an analytic expansion in terms of the monomer-monomer separation
	along the chain. The electrostatic persistence length and the electrostatic
	blobsize are inferred from the crossover between distinct scaling
	ranges. We perform a global analysis of the scaling behavior as a
	function of the screening length xi and electrostatic interaction
	strength beta = l(B)/A(2), where l(B) is the Bjerrum length and A
	is the distance of charges along the polymer chain. We find three
	different scaling regimes, i) A Gaussian-persistent regime with Gaussian
	behavior at small, persistent behavior at intermediate, and isotropically
	swollen behavior at large length scales. This regime occurs for weakly
	charged polymers and only for intermediate values of the screening
	length. The electrostatic persistence length dp is defined as the
	crossover length between the persistent and the asymptotically swollen
	behavior and is given by l(P) similar to beta(1/3)xi(2) ln(-2/3)[beta(1/3)xi]
	and thus disagrees with previous (restricted) variational treatments
	which predict a linear dependence on the screening length xi. ii)
	A Gaussian regime with Gaussian behavior at small and isotropically
	swollen behavior at large length scales. This regime occurs for weakly
	charged polymers and/or strong screening, and the electrostatic repulsion
	between monomers only leads to subfluent corrections to Gaussian
	scaling at small separations, The concept of a persistence length
	is without meaning in this regime. iii) A persistent regime, where
	the chain resembles a stretched rod on intermediate and small scales.
	Here the persistence length is given by the original Odijk prediction,
	l(P) similar to beta xi(2), if the overstretching of the chain is
	avoided. We also investigate the effects of a finite polymer length
	and of an additional excluded-volume interaction, which modify the
	resultant scaling behavior. Applications to experiments and computer
	simulations are discussed.},

	incorporating biological molecules. We investigate the adsorption
	of fibronectin onto polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) films using
	optical waveguide lightmode spectroscopy (OWLS) and atomic force
	microscopy (AFM). PEM films are formed by adsorption onto Si(Ti)O2
	from alternately introduced flowing solutions of anionic poly(sodium
	4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS) and cationic poly(allylamine hydrochloride)
	(PAH). Using OWLS, we find the initial rate and overall extent offibronectin
	adsorption to be greatest on PEM films terminated with a PAH layer.
	The polarizability density of the adsorbed protein layer, as measured
	by its refractive index, is virtually identical on both PAH- and
	PSS-terminated films; the higher adsorbed density on the PAH-terminated
	film is due to an adsorbed layer of roughly twice the thickness.
	The binding of monoclonal antibodies specific to the protein's cell
	binding site is considerably enhanced to fibronectin adsorbed to
	the PSS layer, indicating a more accessible adsorbed layer. With
	increased salt concentration, we find thicker PEM films but considerably
	thinner adsorbed fibronectin layers, owing to increased electrostatic
	screening. Using AFM, we find adsorbed fibronectin layers to contain
	clusters; these are more numerous and symmetric on the PSS-terminated
	film. By considering the electrostatic binding of a segmental model
	fibronectin molecule, we propose a picture of fibronectin adsorbed

  abstract = {Interactions between charged macromolecules (e.g., proteins, nucleic
	acids, polyelectrolytes) and charged surfaces govern many natural
	and industrial processes. We investigate here the influence of an
	applied electric potential on the adsorption of charged polymers,
	and report the following significant result: the adsorption of certain
	amine side chain-containing polycations may become continuous, i.e.,
	asymptotically linear (or nearly linear) in time over hours, upon
	the application of a modest anodic potential. Employing optical waveguide
	lightmode spectroscopy (OWLS) and an indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate,
	we show that asymptotic kinetics, and the adsorbed mass at the onset
	of the asymptotic regime, depend sensitively on polymer chemistry
	(in particular, side chain volume and charge location), increase
	with applied potential and ionic strength (conditions favoring a
	thicker initial layer), and are independent of bulk polymer concentration
	(suggesting postadsorption events to be rate limiting). X-ray photoelectron
	spectra reveal a suppressed polymer charge within layers formed via
	continuous adsorption, but no evidence of electrochemical reactions.
	We propose a mechanism based on polymer-polymer binding within the

  abstract = {Cell focal adhesions are micrometer-sized aggregates of proteins that
	anchor the cell to the extracellular matrix. Within the cell, these
	adhesions are connected to the contractile, actin cytoskeleton; this
	allows the adhesions to transmit forces to the surrounding matrix
	and makes the adhesion assembly sensitive to the rigidity of their
	environment. In this article, we predict the dynamics of focal adhesions
	as a function of the rigidity of the substrate. We generalize previous
	theories and include the fact that the dynamics of proteins that
	adsorb to adhesions are also driven by their coupling to cell contractility
	and the deformation of the matrix. We predict that adhesions reach
	a finite size that is proportional to the elastic compliance of the
	substrate, on a timescale that also scales with the compliance: focal
	adhesions quickly reach a relatively small, steady-state size on
	soft materials. However, their apparent sliding is not sensitive
	to the rigidity of the substrate. We also suggest some experimental
	probes of these ideas and discuss the nature of information that
	can be extracted from cell force microscopy on deformable substrates.},

	The value obtained is checked by computer calculations. We confirm

	the difference??, which represents the average potential in the system.
	On the other hand, if the system is considered as the limit of a
	set of spheres with increasing radii, such that the spheres are neutral
	(system II), we obtain a different value of?el and in this case?i=1/2?el.
	We show explicitly that the Ewald method of summation, used by Fuchs

	regions, which remain at the same positions in space. This migration
	mode agrees with the observation of DNA in highly entangled solutions
	[Ueda , Biophys. Chem. 71, 113 (1998)]. The projection model also
	reproduces the linear-shaped motion. We clarified that the essential
	conditions for linear shaped motion are the sufficient chain length
	of DNA, the small mesh size, and strong confinement by entanglement

	Strongly versus weakly charged polymers},

  abstract = {Previous work has demonstrated adsorption of weakly basic polycations
	to a conducting substrate to be continuous, i.e. asymptotically linear
	in time over hours, under an applied anodic potential [A.P. Ngankam,
	P.R. Van Tassel, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 104 (2007) 1140]. Adsorption
	without apparent saturation requires an interfacial charge regulation,
	which is possible for weakly charged polymers via segment deprotonation.
	We investigate here whether deprotonation is a necessary condition
	for continuous adsorption by comparing the behavior of a weakly and
	a strongly charged polyelectrolyte, the latter containing permanently
	charged segments incapable of deprotonation. We employ optical waveguide
	lightmode spectroscopy (OWLS) to measure adsorption of poly(N-vinyl
	imidazole) (PVI), a weakly basic polycation, and quaternized poly(N-vinyl
	imidazole) (QPVI), a structurally similar polymer with ca. 20% of
	its monomers containing a permanent positive charge, onto indium
	tin oxide (ITO). Under open circuit conditions, we observe both PVI
	and QPVI adsorption to reach a rapid saturation and be essentially
	irreversible. In contrast, at an ITO potential of 1.5 V (versus hydrogen)
	in a 0.1 M NaCl solution, we observe adsorption of both PVI and QPVI
	to be continuous and reversible. In salt free solution, we observe
	PVI but not QPVI to exhibit continuous adsorption at 1.5 V, and for
	both polymers to be essentially irreversibly attached. We propose
	interfacial charge regulation to occur via a deprotonation mechanism
	for PVI, and via a counterion condensation mechanism for QPVI. Continuous
	adsorption is therefore possible for a strongly charged polyelectrolyte,
	via a counterion condensation mechanism; this finding opens the door
	to nanofilms of controlled polymer content containing permanent charges.},

	that microsecond or longer time scales are needed to fully model
	the formation and stability of a raft in a membrane. Although atomistic
	simulations currently are not able to reach this scale, they can
	provide data on the intermolecular forces and correlations that are
	involved in lateral organization. These data can be used to define
	coarse grained models that are capable of predictions of lateral
	organization in membranes. In this paper, we review modeling efforts
	that use interaction data from MD simulations to construct coarse
	grained models for heterogeneous bilayers. In this review we will
	discuss MD simulations done with the aim of gaining the information
	needed to build accurate coarse-grained models. We will then review
	some of the coarse-graining work, emphasizing modeling that has resulted

	growth rate (thickness/bilayer) and polymer surface coverage shows
	a nonmonotonic dependence on salt concentration, first increasing

	interactions control the multilayer assembly process, while at high
	salt concentrations it is dominated by shear flow. We explain this
	nonmonotonic behavior in the framework of a Flory-like theory of
	multilayer formation from polyelectrolyte solution under shear flow.
	Additionally, the PSA process led to multilayer coatings with a radial
	dependence on thickness at lower spin speed in the shear-dominated
	regime. On increasing spin speed, such radial dependence subsided,
	eventually leading to uniform coatings by planarization. The surface
	topography of the multilayered coatings adsorbed at salt concentration

  abstract = { The structure of polyelectrolyte solutions at a charged surface is

	The polymer molecules are modeled as freely jointed chains of charged
	hard spheres, the counterions and co-ions as charged hard spheres,
	and the surface is a planar, impenetrable hard wall with a uniform
	surface charge density. The density functional theory treats the
	ideal gas contribution exactly, uses a weighted density approximation
	for the hard sphere contribution, and a generalized van der Waals
	approximation for the electrostatic contribution. At a fixed surface
	charge density, with increasing concentration of the polyion, the
	simulations show layering as well as charge inversion phenomena resulting
	from an interplay between excluded volume and electrostatic interactions.
	The integrated surface excess is a monotonically decreasing function
	of polymer concentration at high surface charge densities, but a
	nonmonotonic function of polymer concentration at lower surface charge
	densities. The density functional theory is in qualitative agreement
	with simulations for the density profiles but fails to capture the
	layering and charge inversion effects. This suggests that liquid-state
	correlations and coupling between electrostatic and excluded volume
	effects are important factors in the adsorption of charged polymers

  abstract = {A density functional theory is presented for the distribution of charged
	hard spheres (model for salt) around an infinite, rigid, and impenetrable
	charged cylinder (model for DNA or tobacco mosaic virus). The theory
	is based on a weighted density approach where the hard-sphere contribution
	to the one-particle correlation function is evaluated nonperturbatively
	using a position dependent effective density, and the ionic part
	is obtained through a second-order functional Taylor expansion around
	a uniform fluid. The theory is in good agreement with Monte Carlo
	simulations for the density distribution of monovalent, divalent,
	and mixed salts. For axial charge densities corresponding to DNA,
	the hypernetted chain integral equation theory is not as accurate
	as the density functional theory, but both liquid state approaches
	are superior to the Poisson-Boltzmann theory. For higher axial charge
	densities the density functional theory predicts interesting charge
	inversion effects that are absent in the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann
	theory.},

	Specifically, the correlated motion of the mobile ions is ignored
	by identifying the mean field electrostatic potential with the potential

	so that finite size effects are not accounted for. Utilizing the
	generalized van der Waals free energy density functional formulation

	result where both these mechanisms are treated in local and nonlocal

	in the point particle case is avoided and self-consistent density
	profiles can be computed. Nonlocal approximations are shown to be

	will usually include contributions from distributions of permanent
	electric charges, so that the usual assumption of short-ranged forces

	chemical potential to be computed accurately and very quickly and
	thereby permits the methods (freeenergy perturbation, expanded ensembles,
	thermodynamic integration, and histogram-distribution methods) to
	be optimized and compared over a range of densities. The study focuses
	exclusively on the hard-sphere model. This model is simple and well
	characterized; yet it exhibits the essential features that make the
	chemical potential calculation difficult; arguments are presented
	to support the broader applicability of the study. The severe asymmetry
	of particle insertion against particle deletion is highlighted, and
	it is shown that any staged free-energy perturbation method with
	a 'deletion' component is highly prone to systematic error. More
	generally this implies that such methods should always be staged
	in the direction of decreasing entropy. Other findings show that
	uniform sampling is not optimal for umbrellasampling and expanded-ensemble
	applications, although it remains a good rule of thumb for tuning
	these approaches. Among the techniques we study, optimally staged
	insertion and the distribution-histogram methods are the most efficient

  abstract = {In this article, a recently proposed method called the particle mesh
	Ewald (PME) method for computing the long ranged Coulomb interactions
	in for example molecular dynamics simulations is studied. The PME
	method has a complexity [script O](N log N), where N is the total
	number of charges. This complexity should in particular be compared
	with the complexity [script O](N3/2) for the well known Ewald method
	and [script O](N) for the rather new (but already famous) fast multipole
	method (FMM). However, these complexities say nothing about which
	method is fastest at some finite N. The purpose of this article is
	thus to study the PME method and compare its efficiency with the
	Ewald method and the fast multipole method. To enable this, a theoretical
	estimate for the accuracy of the PME method as function of its truncation
	parameters is derived. It is shown that this estimate is very precise
	by comparing it with results obtained from molecular dynamics simulations
	of a molten NaCl. Based on this estimate and very careful time experiments,
	the overall necessary time overhead for the PME method as function
	of N and a required accuracy is predicted. By a direct comparison
	with a similar prediction for the Ewald method and by studying existing
	Ewald-FMM comparisons, it is found that the PME method is significantly
	faster than both the Ewald method and the fast multipole method in
	the important decades N[approximately-equal-to]10^4?10^5},

  abstract = {NAMD is a parallel molecular dynamics code designed for high-performance
	simulation of large biomolecular systems. NAMD scales to hundreds
	of processors on high-end parallel platforms, as well as tens of
	processors on low-cost commodity clusters, and also runs on individual
	desktop and laptop computers. NAMD works with AMBER and CHARMM potential
	functions, parameters, and file formats. This article, directed to
	novices as well as experts, first introduces concepts and methods
	used in the NAMD program, describing the classical molecular dynamics
	force field, equations of motion, and integration methods along with
	the efficient electrostatics evaluation algorithms employed and temperature
	and pressure controls used. Features for steering the simulation
	across barriers and for calculating both alchemical and conformational
	free energy differences are presented. The motivations for and a
	roadmap to the internal design of NAMD, implemented in C++ and based
	on Charm++ parallel objects, are outlined. The factors affecting
	the serial and parallel performance of a simulation are discussed.
	Finally, typical NAMD use is illustrated with representative applications
	to a small, a medium, and a large biomolecular system, highlighting
	particular features of NAMD, for example, the Tcl scripting language.
	The article also provides a list of the key features of NAMD and
	discusses the benefits of combining NAMD with the molecular graphics/sequence
	analysis software VMD and the grid computing/collaboratory software
	BioCoRE. NAMD is distributed free of charge with source code at http://www.ks.uiuc.edu.},

	an exponential growth regime where the thickness increases exponentially

	visualization of the film construction by introducing fluorescent
	polyelectrolytes at different steps during the film buildup. We find
	that, as postulated, PLL diffuses throughout the film down into the
	substrate after each new PLL injection and out of the film after
	each PLL rinsing and further after each HA injection. As PLL reaches
	the outer layer of the film it interacts with the incoming HA, forming
	the new HA/PLL layer. The thickness of this new layer is thus proportional
	to the amount of PLL that diffuses out of the film during the buildup
	step, which explains the exponential growth regime. HA layers are
	also visualized but no diffusion is observed, leading to a stratified
	film structure. We believe that such a diffusion-based buildup mechanism
	explains most of the exponential-like growth processes of polyelectrolyte
	multilayers reported in the literature.},

  abstract = { We report on the development of a self-consistent field model that
	describes the competitive adsorption of nonionic alkyl-(ethylene
	oxide) surfactants and nonionic polymer poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)
	from aqueous solutions onto silica. The model explicitly describes
	the response to the pH and the ionic strength. On an inorganic oxide
	surface such as silica, the dissociation of the surface depends on
	the pH. However, salt ions can screen charges on the surface, and
	hence, the number of dissociated groups also depends on the ionic
	strength. Furthermore, the solvent quality for the EO groups is a
	function of the ionic strength. Using our model, we can compute bulk
	parameters such as the average size of the polymer coil and the surfactant
	CMC. We can make predictions on the adsorption behavior of either
	polymers or surfactants, and we have made adsorption isotherms, i.e.,
	calculated the relationship between the surface excess and its corresponding
	bulk concentration. When we add both polymer and surfactant to our
	mixture, we can find a surfactant concentration (or, more precisely,
	a surfactant chemical potential) below which only the polymer will
	adsorb and above which only the surfactant will adsorb. The corresponding
	surfactant concentration is called the CSAC. In a first-order approximation,
	the surfactant chemical potential has the CMC as its upper bound.
	We can find conditions for which CMC < CSAC . This implies that the
	chemical potential that the surfactant needs to adsorb is higher
	than its maximum chemical potential, and hence, the surfactant will
	not adsorb. One of the main goals of our model is to understand the
	experimental data from one of our previous articles. We managed to
	explain most, but unfortunately not all, of the experimental trends.
	At the end of the article we discuss the possibilities for improving
	the model. },

  abstract = { In technological applications, it is increasingly important to understand
	and predict interfacial phenomena. Using a self-consistent field
	model within the ScheutjensFleer discretization scheme, we have developed
	a molecularly realistic model of the adsorption of poly(ethylene
	oxide) (PEO) onto silica from an aqueous solution. The bulk solution
	consists of water, PEO, 1:1 electrolyte, protons, and hydroxyl ions.
	The solvent quality is good below and becomes poor above a threshold
	ionic strength (of around 1 M). The silica surface features a number
	of silanol groups that have an affinity for PEO (by means of H bonding)
	when these groups are not dissociated. In line with experimental
	data, the surface changes from adsorbing to nonadsorbing at a sufficiently
	high pH. Even though PEO is uncharged, there is a complex effect
	of the ionic strength on the interfacial characteristics. For example,
	we report a non-monotonic behavior of the adsorbed amount as a function
	of ionic strength. Going from a low to a high ionic strength at a
	neutral or slightly basic pH, the adsorbed amount initially decreases
	as the surface affinity decreases (caused by the reduction of adsorption
	sites when, as a result of screening, the surface is increasingly
	charged) but then increases as a result of a reduction in solvent
	quality. These results indicate that molecularly realistic models
	can reveal much richer interfacial behavior than anticipated from
	generic models. The predictions follow many experimental findings.

	The behaviour of the structure factor in the region of the first

	Pdua (J. Phys. Chem. B 2006, 110, 19586). In particular, the 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium
	cation EMIM+ is studied in the presence of three different anions,
	namely, chloride Cl-, tetrafluoroborate B, and bis((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyly)imide
	TF2N-. In the focus of the present study are the static distributions
	of anions and cations around a cation as a function of anion size.
	It is found that the preferred positions of the anions change from
	being close to the imidazolium hydrogens to being above and below
	the imidazolium rings. Lifetimes of hydrogen bonds are calculated
	and found to be of the same order of magnitude as those of pure liquid
	water and of some small primary alcohols. Three kinds of short-range
	cation-cation orderings are studied, among which the offset stacking
	dominates in all of the investigated ionic liquids. The offset stacking
	becomes weaker from [EMIM][Cl] to [EMIM][BF4] to [EMIM][TF2N]. Further
	investigation of the dynamical behavior reveals that cations in [EMIM][TF2N]
	have a slower tumbling motion compared with those in [EMIM][Cl] and
	[EMIM][BF4] and that pure diffusive behavior can be observed after
	1.5 ns for all three systems at temperatures 90 K above the corresponding

  abstract = {A broad range of manufactured products and biological fluids are colliods.
	The ability to understand and control the processes (of scientific,
	technological and industrial interest) in which such colloids are
	involved relies upon a precise knowledge of the electrical double
	layer. The traditional approach to describing this ion cloud around
	colloidal particles has been the Gouy-Chapman model developed on
	the basis of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation. Since the early 1980s,
	however, more sophisticated theoretical treatments have revealed
	both quantitative and qualitative deficiencies in the Poisson-Boltzmann
	theory, particularly at high ionic strengths and/or high surface
	charge densities. This review deals with these novel approaches,
	which are mostly computer simulations and approximate integral equation
	theories based on the so-called primitive model. Special attention
	is paid to phenomena that cannot be accounted for by the classic
	theory as a result of neglecting ion size correlations, such as overcharging,
	namely, the counterion concentration in the immediate neighborhood
	of the surface is so large that the particle surface is overcompensated.
	Other illustrative examples are the nonmonotonic behavior of the
	electrostatic potential and attractive interactions between equally
	charged surfaces. These predictions are certainly remarkable and,
	on paper, they can have an effect on experimentally measurable quantities
	(for instance, electrophoretic mobility). Even so, these new approaches
	have scarcely been applied in practice. Thus a critical survey on
	the relevance of ion size correlation in real systems is also included.
	Overcharging of macroions can also be brought about by adsorption
	of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes. Noteworthy examples and theoretical
	approaches for them are also briefly reviewed.},

  abstract = {Abstract: In this paper, the electric double layer (EDL) of a charged
	plane in the presence of mixtures of 1:1 and 3:1 electrolytes has
	been investigated through Monte Carlo (MC) simulations using a nonrestrictive
	primitive model of EDL. In particular, the charge inversion in colloids
	(attributable to an accumulation of counterions on the surface) can
	be better understood by means of the simulations performed here.
	Moreover, two mechanisms proposed for charge inversion are probed:
	The formation of a strongly correlated layer (SCL) of multivalent
	counterions and excluded volume effects (to which we will also refer
	as ion size correlations). Our results are in agreement with the
	behavior found experimentally for some model colloids with increasing
	the concentration of monovalent salt in the presence of trivalent
	ions, which clearly supports the relevance of ion size correlations.
	In contrast, certain disagreement with predictions of SCL theories
	is reported.},

  abstract = {Layer-by-layer deposition of sodium carboxymethylcellulose (NaCMC)
	and chitosan (CHI) was used to create polyelectrolyte multilayers
	on ellipsoidal beta-FeOOH particles at low ionic strength. Using
	electro-optics, we investigated the formation of films in dependence
	on the polyelectrolyte charge density by controlling pH of the dipping
	solutions. We found out a linear growth of the CMC/CHI films when
	they are constructed from highly charged CHI (at pH 4.0) and weakly
	charged NaCMC (at pH 4.0 and 5.5). The hydrodynamic thickness of
	the film constructed at pH 4.0/4.0 is unusually large for a linearly
	growing film (ca. 220 nm after deposition of 8 bilayers), but it
	strongly decreases (ca. 4 times) with increasing ionization of NaCMC
	(at pH 5.5). In both cases, the multilayer buildup proceeded through
	a series of adsorption-desorption steps. This was explained by a
	partial loss of CHI from the film surface on exposure to the solution
	of longer NaCMC molecules. The irregular film growth correlated quite
	well with the variations in the electrical polarizability of the
	polymer-coated particles. This correlation enabled us to conclude
	that the adsorption of both polymers occurs only on the film surface,
	with no diffusion in and out of the film bulk during deposition of
	each CMC/CHI bilayer.},

  abstract = { We report further development of a pair potential for two identically
	charged rodlike polyions oriented in parallel. An attractive force
	mediated by condensed counterions of any valence, including univalent,
	is identified for separation distances between a Debye screening
	length and about a third of a Debye length. The characteristics of
	the potential are explored as a function of ionic strength, dielectric
	constant, counterion valence, and charge density of the polyions.
	The work required to assemble more than two polyions in parallel
	array is shown not to be pairwise additive. The free energy of assembling
	many parallel polyions in a hexagonally ordered cluster is calculated
	as a function of the number N of polyions in the cluster. The free
	energy has a minimum at a finite cluster size. Discrepancies between
	the theoretical structure of the stable cluster and experimental
	observations on polyelectrolyte clusters (with univalent counterions)
	are discussed, and it is tentatively concluded that the apparently
	loose and disordered clusters observed in solution may be understood
	as stabilized by relatively few pairwise attractive interactions.

	Flux was simulated by Monte Carlo methods and by analytical expressions,
	which showed that the pH-dependent component of flux was essentially
	mirrored by the solution titration curve of the weak acid. In situ
	attenuated total internal reflection Fourier transform IR measurements
	revealed that multilayer probe concentration was independent of both

	to the nonlinear Poisson?????????Boltzmann (PB) equation, is reported.
	The program can divide space into multiple regions containing different
	dielectric constants and can treat systems containing mixed salt
	solutions where the valence and concentration of each ion is different.
	The electrostatic free energy is calculated by decomposing the various
	energy terms into Coulombic interactions so that that the calculated
	free energies are independent of the lattice used to solve the PB
	equation. This, together with algorithms that optimally position
	polarization charges on the molecular surface, leads to a significant
	decrease in the dependence of the electrostatic free energy on the
	resolution of the lattice used to solve the PB equation and, hence,
	to a remarkable improvement in the precision of the calculated values.
	The Gauss?????????Seidel algorithm used in the current version of
	DelPhi is retained so that the new program retains many of the optimization
	features of the old one. The program uses dynamic memory allocation
	and can easily handle systems requiring large grid dimensionsfor
	example a 3003 system can be conveniently treated on a single SGI
	R12000 processor. An algorithm that estimates the best relaxation
	parameter to solve the nonlinear equation for a given system is described,
	and is implemented in the program at run time. A number of applications
	of the program are presented.},

	is important for the emerging theory of nonequilibrium phenomena,

	biophysical interest. However, the links among the different approaches
	and the limitations of these approaches are not fully understood.

	models; (b) discussion of the rigorous mathematical results; (c)
	identification of the physical mechanisms underlying the validity

  abstract = {We study nonlocal electrostatics in inhomogeneous dielectric environments
	on the sub-nanometer scale using a recently introduced polarization
	energy functional. This functional is able to generate a wavevector-dependent
	dielectric function epsilon(q) that reflects local correlations in
	the medium's polarization. Its longitudinal component either decays
	continuously from its macroscopic continuum value to one at large
	q, or additionally exhibits two poles with a negative band at intermediate
	wavevectors (overscreening), which is characteristic of polar fluids
	such as water. We show that the functional reproduces known nonlocal
	electrostatic effects: the pair potential between point charges or
	Born ions in water at distances less than 5 angstrom is strongly
	modified, and the Born solvation energy is found to either decrease
	or increase relative to its local electrostatics value, depending
	on which approximation is chosen for epsilon(q). We then apply the
	functional to geometries that can no longer be treated analytically,
	such as a molecular pore of finite length. In such an anisotropic
	dielectric background transverse correlations in the polarization
	field no longer vanish and can contribute to substantial modifications
	of the dielectric barrier for ion translocation in the regime of
	intermediate pore diameters of 6-10 angstrom.},

	This allows us to treat the electrostatic correlation attraction
	semianalytically by reducing the problem to interaction between layers
	of adsorbed but mobile counterions neutralizing surfaces of similar
	charge density. Both when the counterion distribution is in the two-dimensional
	limit, and when it has a more realistic three-dimensional character,
	Coulomb repulsion between counterions produces an alternation of
	positive and negative charges at the surface. Two such apposing patterns
	adjust complementarily to each other, resulting in electrostatic
	attraction of the surfaces. The magnitude of this attraction depends
	solely on the surface charge density and the solution dielectric
	constant, while its range is defined by the size of the planar correlation
	hole around each ion. The attraction is stable with respect to the
	disruptive influence of planar thermal motion of the ions. The theory
	enables construction of a universal function which, after being scaled
	with the appropriate parameters of the system, yields the attractive

	several succeseful ideas introduced over the years in the field of
	the rubber elasticity. The topological constraints imposed by the
	neighboring network chains on a given network are represented by
	the confining potential that changes upon network deformation. This
	topological potential restricts fluctuations of the network chain
	to the nonaffinely deformed confining tube. Network chains are allowed
	to fluctuate and redistribute their length along the contour of their
	confining tubes. The dependence of the stress on the elongation coefficient
	for the uniaxially deformed network is usially represented in the
	form of the Mooney stress, f*(1/) = /( - 1/2). We find a simple expression
	for the Mooney stress, f*(1/) = Gc + Ge/(0.74 + 0.61-1/2 - 0.35),
	where Gc and Ge are phantom and entangled network moduli. This allows
	one to analyze the experimental data in the form of the universal

	use of classical molecular dynamics methods, as a very large number
	(tens to hundreds of thousands) of atoms are involved over timescales
	of many nanoseconds. The methodology for treating short-range bonded
	and van der Waals interactions has matured. However, long-range electrostatic
	interactions still represent a bottleneck in simulations. In this
	article, we introduce the basic issues for an accurate representation
	of the relevant electrostatic interactions. In spite of the huge
	computational time demanded by most biomolecular systems, it is no
	longer necessary to resort to uncontrolled approximations such as
	the use of cutoffs. In particular, we discuss the Ewald summation
	methods, the fast particle mesh methods, and the fast multipole methods.
	We also review recent efforts to understand the role of boundary
	conditions in systems with long-range interactions, and conclude
	with a short perspective on future trends.},

  abstract = { Protein adsorption on polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEMUs) was evaluated
	using a combination of synthetic polyelectrolytes and proteins, including
	serum albumin, fibrinogen, and lysozyme. Variables such as surface
	and protein charge, polymer hydrophobicity, and hydrophilic repulsion
	were introduced to probe interaction mechanisms. Quantitative analysis
	with reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, optical
	waveguiding, and UVvis absorption, together with qualitative information
	from atomic force microscopy, provided a coordinated picture for
	what drives protein adsorption and how the molecules are disposed
	on the multilayer surface. It was found that multilayers bearing
	a particular surface charge sorbed biomolecules if they were of opposite
	charge, yielding significant loadings within the bulk PEMU. Adsorption
	of like-charged proteins, as surface aggregates, occurred to a much
	lower extent, driven by nonelectrostatic forces. A diblock copolymer
	comprising a hydrophilic poly(ethylene oxide) block was capable of
	further minimizing protein adsorption as a result of hydrophilic
	repulsion, although none of the surfaces tested defeated protein
	adsorption completely. However, poly(acrylic acid) homopolymer was
	quite effective in this respect. A composition gradient, formed during
	multilayer buildup, induced a gradient in hydrophilicity through
	the PEMU, which is an efficient and economical method of creating
	a protein-resistant surface. },

	consisting of poly(styrenesulfonate) (PSS), poly(diallyldimethylammonium)

	crystal microbalance. The increase of temperature in the deposition
	process was shown to have a considerable effect on the rate of the

	deposition was found to be stronger than on the PAH/PSS deposition.
	The increasing temperature was found to extend the exponential buildup
	regime in all of the studied systems. A buildup model was created
	to simulate the buildup and to explain the effect of temperature.
	The model is based on the assumption that each deposition step leads
	to a quasi-equilibrium between the concentration of the polymer repeating
	unit in solution and the composition of the layer. According to the
	model, the layer-by-layer buildup is inherently exponential, becoming
	linear whenever diffusion is not fast enough to carry the polymer
	within the entire thickness of the film. This buildup model is discussed
	jointly with the earlier published three-zone model of the polyelectrolyte
	multilayers. The rate of the buildup is characterized by growth exponent
	beta. The temperature dependence of the growth exponent is discussed
	in connection with the thermodynamic parameters of the deposition.},

	The rate of shrinkage was greatly enhanced, however, when the size
	decreased to less than 20 to 50 particles, depending on the location

	DNA oligomers by attachment of peptide nucleic acid amphiphiles (PNAA)
	to particular sequences on the oligomers, followed by their separation
	from unbound oligomers using hydrophobic interaction chromatography
	(HIC). Use of alky-modified HIC/media (butyl and octyl sepharose)over
	phenyl-modified media (phenyl sepharose) reduced the elution time
	of unbound DNA while not affecting the elution time of the PHAA/DNA
	complex. Modifying the alane tail lenght for PNAA from C-12 to C-18
	increased slightly the retention of PNAA/DNA duplexes. By combning
	these two refinements, we show that sequence-specific purifications
	of DNA oligomers 60 bases length or more can be achieved with high
	resolution even when the PNAA alkane is attached to the centre of
	the target strand. The insensitivity of the PNAA/DNA duplex binding
	to choice of HIC media appers to be due to a surface-induced aggregation
	DNA. We also report on the use of batch HIC as an adequate predictor
	of elution profiles in linear gradient HIC, and its potential to
	considerably reduce purification times by applying step gradients.},

  abstract = {End-labeled free-solution electrophoresis (ELFSE) is an alternative
	approach to gel-based methods for size-based electrophoretic separation
	of DNA. In ELFSE, an electrically neutral "drag-tag" is appended
	to DNA to add significant hydrodynamic drag, thereby breaking its
	constant charge-to-friction ratio. Current drag-tag architecture
	relies on covalent attachment of polymers to each DNA molecule. We
	have recently proposed the use of micellar drag-tags in conjunction
	with sequence-specific hybridization of peptide nucleic acid amphiphiles
	(PNAAs). This work investigates the effect of multiple PNAA attachment
	on DNA resolution using MEKC. Simultaneous PNAA hybridization allows
	for the separation of long DNA targets, up to 1012 bases, using micellar
	drag-tags. Each PNAA handle independently interacts with the micellar
	phase, reducing the overall mobility of this complex relative to
	individual PNAA binding. The sequence- and size-based dependence
	of this separation technique is maintained with multiple PNAA binding
	over a range of DNA sizes. Results are accurately described by ELFSE
	theory, yielding alpha = 54 for single-micelle tagging and alpha
	= 142 for dual-micelle tagging. This method is the first example
	of a non-covalent drag-tag used to separate DNA of 1000 bases based
	on both size and sequence.},

  abstract = {Cake filtration is a widely used solid-liquid separation process.
	However, the high flow resistance of the nanoporous filter cake lowers
	the efficiency of the process significantly. The structure and thus
	the permeability of the filter cakes depend on the compressive load
	acting on the particles, the particles size, and the agglomeration
	of the particles. The latter is determined by the particle charge
	and the ionic strength of the suspension, as described by the Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek
	(DLVO) theory. In this paper, we propose a combined stochastic rotation
	dynamics (SRD) and molecular dynamics (MD) methodology to simulate
	the cake formation. The simulations give further insight into the
	dependency of the filter cakes' structure on the agglomeration of
	the particles, which cannot be accessed experimentally. The permeability,
	as investigated with lattice Boltzmann (LB) simulations of flow through
	the discretized cake, depends on the particle size and porosity,
	and thus on the agglomeration of the particles. Our results agree
	qualitatively with experimental data obtained from colloidal boehmite
	suspensions. },

	polymers using hydrodynamic simulations and scaling arguments. We
	investigate the influence of polymer length, salt concentration,
	electric field strength and polyion concentration. We show that the
	polarizabilty is drastically reduced not only for high but also for
	very low salt concentrations, i.e. when the ionic clouds of neighboring
	rods start to overlap. As the electric polarizability (favoring rod
	orientation parallel to the electric field) decreases, the elasto-hydrodynamic
	orientation due to rod bending (favoring perpendicular alignment)
	can take over for not too stiff rods. This furnishes a generic mechanism
	for the experimentally well-known birefringence anomaly of a wide
	class of charged rod-like systems.},

  year = {2001},
  volume = {34},
  pages = {592-598},
  number = {3},
  abstract = { A mechanism for distributing excess polymer surface charge is used
	to model the growth of multilayers of strongly charged polyelectrolytes.
	Two parameters are required for the semiempirical analysis: the surface,
	or unrestricted, charge overcompensation level, phi, which is assumed
	to decrease exponentially from the film surface to bulk, and the
	characteristic length for this decay, lcp, which is termed the charge
	penetration length. Modeling of the data reveals that only modest
	levels of polymer charge overcompensation are required to account
	for large increments in polymer thickness, realized at high salt
	concentration, since the excess charge is distributed over several
	layers. Experimentally, phi appears to be roughly independent of
	salt concentration. The thickness increment is primarily controlled
	by lcp, which is about 2.5 nominal layers for the system studied.
	Whereas the growth conditions and polyelectrolyte type lead to the
	formation of intrinsically compensated multilayers in this work,
	conditions for obtaining extrinsic compensation are also discussed.
	Kinetic vs thermodynamic limitations for polymer addition during
	a deposition cycle are contrasted. },

	30 ion pairs under bulk conditions using a charge fitting procedure

	Especially the liquid state DFT results give convincing evidence
	for a reduced ionic charge on the ions. The similarity of both results
	suggest that the delocalization of the Cl charge is due only to local
	interactions. The relevance of our results is 2-fold; on the one
	hand they shed light on the basic property of the liquid and its
	reduced ionic character, and on the other hand, the ab initio derived
	partial charges provide a fundamental theoretical basis for the recent
	attempts to use the total ionic charge as an adjustable parameter.
	Furthermore, all our partial charges are subject to large fluctuations,
	hinting to the importance of polarization effects.},

  abstract = {Multilayers of charged polymers can be formed by the alternating adsorption
	of polyanions and polycations. By this so-called layer-by-layer self-assembly
	method, planar surfaces or colloidal templates can be coated. This
	method is reviewed here with respect to the basic physical principles
	governing multilayer formation. Particular emphasis is put on the
	adsorption process of a single polyelectrolyte layer to a multilayer
	surface as the process controlling the charge complexation and the
	local molecular structure. Then, the implications for the properties
	of the multilayer assembly are discussed. In particular, molecular
	properties such as the internal stoichiometry, the local interactions,
	and the conformation on a molecular scale are reviewed.},

	properties of polyelectrolyte multilayers formed by layer-by-layer
	assembly. Reflectivity techniques monitor the water content and swelling
	behavior, while spin relaxation monitors water mobility. Odd-even
	effects in dependence on the number of layers are discussed in terms
	of an influence of the terminating layer. Other novel methodological
	approaches like X-ray microscopy or NMR cryoporometry address the
	water content in hollow capsules, and the water pore size distribution,
	respectively. Multilayer material properties are relevant for different
	applications. As a novel concept, dielectric properties are monitored
	in a field effect transistor device. Ion mobility and redox processes
	in multilayers are revealed by the electrochemical properties. Mechanical
	properties of multilayers, studied by colloidal probe atomic force
	microscopy depend on the conformation of the polymers involved.},

  abstract = {The vast majority of molecular dynamics simulations are based on nonpolarizable
	force fields with fixed partial charges for all atoms. The traditional
	way to obtain these charges are quantum-mechanical calculations performed
	prior to simulation. Unfortunately, the set of the partial charges
	heavily relies on the method and the basis set used. Therefore, investigations
	of the influence of charge variation on simulation data are necessary
	in order to validate various charge sets. This paper elucidates the
	consequences of different charge sets on the structure and dynamics
	of the ionic liquid: 1-ethyl-3-methyl-imidazolium dicyanoamide. The
	structural features seem to be more or less independent of the partial
	charge set pointing to a dominance of shape force as modeled by Lennard-Jones
	parameters. This can be seen in the radial distribution and orientational
	correlation functions. The role of electrostatic forces comes in
	when studying dynamical properties. Here, significant deviations
	between different charge sets can be observed. Overall, dynamics
	seems to be governed by viscosity. In fact, all dynamical parameters
	presented in this work can be converted from one charge set to another
	by viscosity scaling.},

  abstract = {Vesicles consisting of a bilayer membrane of amphiphilic lipid molecules
	are remarkably flexible surfaces that show an amazing variety of
	shapes of different symmetry and topology. Owing to the fluidity
	of the membrane, shape transitions such as budding can be induced
	by temperature changes or the action of optical tweezers. Thermally
	excited shape fluctuations are both strong and slow enough to be
	visible by video microscopy. Depending on the physical conditions,
	vesicles adhere to and unbind from each other or a substrate.
	
	<br /><br />This article describes the systematic physical theory
	developed to understand the static and dynamic aspects of membrane
	and vesicle configurations. The preferred shapes arise from a competition
	between curvature energy, which derives from the bending elasticity
	of the membrane, geometrical constraints such as fixed surface area
	and fixed enclosed volume, and a signature of the bilayer aspect.
	These shapes of lowest energy are arranged into phase diagrams, which
	separate regions of different symmetry by continuous or discontinuous
	transitions. The geometrical constraints affect the fluctuations
	around these shapes by creating an effective tension.
	
	<br /><br />For vesicles of non-spherical topology, the conformal
	invariance of the curvature energy leads to conformal diffusion,
	which signifies a one-fold degeneracy of the ground state. Unbinding
	and adhesion transitions arise from the balance between attractive
	interactions and entropic repulsion or a cost in bending energy,
	respectively. Both the dynamics of equilibrium fluctuations and the
	dynamics of shape transformations are governed not only by viscous
	damping in the surrounding liquid but also by internal friction if
	the two monolayers slip over each other. More complex membranes such
	as that of the red blood cell exhibit a variety of new phenomena
	because of coupling between internal degrees of freedom and external
	geometry.},

	large in high salt conditions, amounting to 20-40 \% of the bare
	surface charge. However, full charge inversion is not obtained in
	thermodynamical equilibrium for physical values of the parameters.
	The overcharging increases with addition of salt, but does not have
	a simple scaling form with the bare surface charge. Our results indicate
	that a more evolved explanation is needed in order to understand

	surfaces, we derive simple scaling laws for the polyelectrolyte adsorption
	and overcharging. We show that the overcharging scales linearly with
	the bare surface charge, but its magnitude is very small in comparison
	to the surface charge. In contrast with the attractive surface, here
	the overcharging is found to decrease substantially with addition
	of salt. In the intermediate range of weak repulsive surfaces, the
	behavior with addition of salt crosses over from increasing overcharging

  abstract = {We investigate the phenomenon of multilayer formation via layer-by-layer
	deposition of alternating charged polyelectrolytes. Using mean-field
	theory, we find that a strong short-range attraction between the
	two types of polymer chains is essential for the formation of multilayers.
	For strong enough short-range attraction, the adsorbed amount per
	layer increases (after an initial decrease), and finally it stabilizes
	in the form of a polyelectrolyte multilayer that can be repeated
	hundreds of times. For weak short-range attraction between any two
	adjacent layers, the adsorbed amount (per added layer) decays as
	the distance from the surface increases, until the chains stop adsorbing
	altogether. The dependence of the threshold value of the short-range
	attraction as function of the polymer charge fraction and salt concentration
	is calculated.},

  pages = {385},
  abstract = {In computer simulations of water between hydrophobic walls the results
	exhibit a strong dependence upon the boundary conditions applied.
	With the minimum image (MI) convention the water molecules tend to
	be orientationally ordered throughout the simulation cell (Valleau,
	J. P., and Gardner, A. A., 1987, J. chem. Phys., 86, 4162) whereas,
	if a spherical cut-off (SC) is applied, strong orientational order
	is found only in the immediate vicinity of the surface (Lee, C. Y.,
	McCammon, J. A., and Rossky, P. J., 1984, J. chem. Phys., 80, 4448).
	These conflicting observations have remained unresolved, and clearly
	raise troubling questions concerning the validity of simulation results
	for water between surfaces of all types. In the present paper we
	explore this problem by carrying out a detailed analysis of the results
	obtained with various types of boundary condition. These include
	Ewald calculations carried out with a central simulation cell adapted
	to describe the slab geometry of interest. It is shown that the order
	observed in MI calculations is an artefact of that particular truncation.
	
	The reason for this is isolated and discussed. Similar problems are
	found if a cylindrical cut-off is employed. The Ewald and SC methods
	gave qualitatively similar results for systems similar to those considered
	in previous simulations. However, for some geometries problems can
	also arise with the SC method. We conclude that in general the slab-adapted
	Ewald method is the safest choice.},

  abstract = {The modeling and nature of the physisorption of water at the metal
	(Hg)-water interface is explored in this paper. We have evaluated
	potential models that fit into three general classes that are employed
	in the literature. These classes are distinguished by the manner
	in which the isotropic interactions between the metal and the water
	are modeled: namely, as non-attractive, weakly attractive, and strongly
	attractive. In the present studies the metal is described by a jellium
	model. In our model, in addition to the isotropic water potential
	there is an interaction between the jellium and the water molecules
	which depends on the orientation of the water molecule with respect
	to the metal surface. We find that hard potentials without isotropic
	attractive terms dewet. The density of water near hydrocarbon-like
	potentials remains close to the bulk value but the interaction isn't
	strong enough to structure the water near the interface, nor are
	the adsorption energies sufficiently high. The strongly attractive
	potentials seem to be the most appropriate. For such models we have
	checked the sensitivity of the results to the parameters in our model
	including surface corrugation. We find that the structural results
	are insensitive to the parameters employed suggesting that they not
	only provide a good classical description of the Hg-water interface
	but may be readily adaptable to describe the physisorption of water
	on metals in general. Although we find the layering of water molecules
	and the pattern of hydrogen bonding near these surfaces, which have
	been described as ice-like in previous studies, the actual arrangement
	of the water molecules near these surfaces is distinctly different
	from the structure of ice. (C) 1997 American Institute of Physics.},

	chloride complexation of metals in such brines increases the solubility

	to a "hydrous molten salt" at high P and T has been argued to stabilize
	an aqueous fluid phase in the deep crust.In this work, we have done
	molecular dynamic simulations using classical potentials to determine
	the nature of concentrated (0.5-16 m) NaCl-water mixtures under ambient
	(25degreesC, 1 bar), hydrothermal (325degreesC, 1 kbar) and deep
	crustal (625degreesC, 15 kbar) conditions. We used the well-established
	SPCE model for water together with the Smith and Dang Lennard-Jones
	potentials for the ions (J. Chem. Phys., 1994, 100, 3757). With increasing
	temperature at 1 kbar, the dielectric constant of water decreases
	to give extensive ion-association and the formation of polyatomic
	(NanClm)n-m clusters in addition to simple NaCl ion pairs. Large
	polyatomic (NanClm)n-m clusters resemble what would be expected in
	a hydrous NaCl melt in which water and NaCl were completely miscible.
	Although ion association decreases with pressure, temperatures of
	625degreesC are not enough to overcome pressures of 15 kbar; consequently,
	there is still enhanced Na-Cl association in brines under deep crustal
	conditions.},

	high salt concentrations, where the ratio of Debye length (kappa(-1))
	to the polyion radius (a) is sufficiently small ((kappa a)(-1) less

	clarifies the connection between the exact solution of the PB equation

	Away from the surface this attraction can be taken into account by
	a new boundary condition for the: concentration of counterions near

	condition for a charged flat surface, a cylinder, and a sphere. In

  abstract = {Abstract: We report molecular dynamics studies on the solvation of
	sodium chloride in the 1-butyl-3-methyl-imidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide
	ionic liquid ([BMI][Tf2N] IL). We first consider the potential of
	mean force for dissociating a single Na+Cl- ion pair, showing that
	the latter prefers to be undissociated rather than dissociated (by
	ca. 9 kcal/mol), with a free energy barrier of ca. 5 kcal/mol (at
	d 5.2 ???) for the association process. The preference for Na+Cl-
	association is also observed from a 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation
	of a concentrated solution, where the Na+Cl- ions tend to form oligomers
	and microcrystals in the IL. Conversely, the simulation of Na13Cl14-
	and Na14Cl13+ cubic microcrystals (with, respectively, Cl- and Na+
	at the vertices) does not lead to dissolution in the IL. Among these,
	Na14Cl13+ is found to be better solvated than Na13Cl14-, mainly due
	to the stronger Na+?????????Tf2N- interactions as compared to the
	Cl-?????????BMI+ interactions at the vertices of the cube. We finally
	consider the solid/liquid interface between the 100 face of NaCl
	and the IL, revealing that, in spite of its polar nature, the crystal
	surface is solvated by the less polar IL components (CF3(Tf2N) and
	butyl(BMI) groups) rather than by the polar ones (O(Tf2N) and imidazolium(BMI)
	ring). Specific ordering at the interface is described for both Tf2N-
	anions and BMI+ cations. In the first IL layer, the ions are rather
	parallel to the surface, whereas in the second "layer" they are more
	perpendicular. A similar IL structure is found at the surface of
	the all-neutral Na0Cl0 solid analogue, confirming that the solvation
	of the crystal is rather "apolar", due to the mismatch between the
	IL and the crystal ions. Several comparisons with water, methanol,
	or different BMI+-based ILs as solvents are presented, allowing us
	to better understand the specificity of the ionic liquid-NaCl interactions.},

	counterions may undergo charge inversion as the counterions adsorb
	to its surface. We use the theory of charge inversion to examine
	the case of a deformable, porous macroion which may adsorb multivalent
	ions into its bulk to form a three-dimensional strongly-correlated
	liquid. This adsorption may lead to non-monotonic changes in the
	size of the macroion as multivalent ions are added to the solution.
	The macroion first shrinks as its bare charge is screened and then
	reswells as the adsorbed ions invert the sign of the net charge.
	We derive a value for the outward pressure experienced by such a
	macroion as a function of the ion concentration in solution. We find
	that for small deviations in the concentration of multivalent ions
	away from the neutral point (where the net charge of the body is
	zero), the swollen size grows parabolically with the logarithm of
	the ratio of multivalent ion concentration to the concentration at
	the neutral point.},

  volume = {237},
  pages = {73--80},

  abstract = {Summary: Upon compression between two pistons an end-tethered polymer
	chain undergoes an abrupt transition from a confined coil state to
	an inhomogeneous flower-like conformation that is partially escaped
	from the gap. In the thermodynamic limit the system demonstrates
	a first-order phase transition. A rigorous analytical theory of this
	phenomenon for a Gaussian chain is presented in two ensembles: a)
	the H-ensemble, in which the distance H between pistons plays the
	role of the control parameter, and b) the conjugate f-ensemble in
	which the external compression force f is the independent parameter.
	A loop region for langf(H)rang with negative compressibility exists
	in the H-ensemble, while in the f-ensemble langH(f)rang is strictly
	monotonic. The average lateral forces taken as functions of H (or
	langHrang, respectively) have distinctly different behavior in the
	two ensembles. This result is a clear counterexample of the main
	principles of statistical mechanics stating that all ensembles are
	equivalent in the thermodynamic limit. Another theorem states that
	the thermodynamic potential as a function of volume must be concave
	everywhere. We demonstrated that the exact free energy in the H-ensemble
	contradicts this statement. Inapplicability of these fundamental
	theorems to a macromolecule undergoing the escape transition is clearly
	related to the fact that phase coexistence in the present system
	is strictly impossible. This is a direct consequence of the tethering
	and the absence of global translational degrees of freedom of the

	chains in low monovalent salt solutions collapse into nearly neutral
	compact structures when the density of multivalent salt approaches
	that of the monomers. With further addition of multivalent salt the
	chains redissolve acquiring expanded-coiled conformations. We study
	the redissolution transition using a two-state model (F.J. Solis,
	M. Olvera de la Cruz, J. Chem. Phys. 112, 2030 (2000)). The redissolution
	occurs a hen there is a high degree of screening of the electrostatic
	interactions between monomers, thus reducing the energy of the expanded
	state. The transition is determined by the chemical potential of
	the multivalent ions in the solution, mu and the inverse screening
	length, kappa. The transition point also depends on the charge distribution
	along the chain but is nearly independent of the molecular weight
	and degree of flexibility of the polyelectrolytes. We generate a
	diagram of mu versus kappa (2) where we find two regions of expanded
	conformations, one with charged chains and the other with overcharged
	(inverted charge) chains, separated by a collapsed nearly neutral
	conformation region. The collapse and redissolution transitions occur
	when the trajectory of the properties of the salt crosses the boundaries
	between these regions. We find that in most cases the redissolution
	occurs within the same expanded branch from which the chain precipitates.},

	of the heterocyclic -systems with themselves, with any other benzene

	the formation of -interactions between benzene-benzene rings found
	in that particular compound. The -systems in all the three categories
	prefer to form offset stacking ??? interaction geometry. The benzene

	found to prefer offset stacking geometry, which may be due to the
	influence of the heteroatom. The -systems in these heterocyclic structures

	charge or ionic strength, within reasonable limits. Thus we see a
	characteristic double layer at neutral surfaces and the charge distribution
	oscillates into the bulk. Finally, preliminary work on calculating

	of monomodal polyelectrolyte complex (PEC) nanoparticles, prepared
	by mixing two solutions of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes (PELs)
	under variation of ionic strength and applying centrifugation. This
	work aims at the better understanding of recently reported experimental
	studies, which demonstrated that consecutive centrifugation results
	in the removal of small primary PEC particles in polymodal dispersions
	and receipt of monomodal PEC dispersions of secondary PEC particles.
	In order to describe this effect and the possibilities of particle
	size regulation in PEC dispersions, a novel particle coagulation
	model, based on the combination of the mean-field theory of Smoluchowski
	and the Fuchs stability approach including a classical DLVO potential
	of interparticle interactions, was used in this study. The aggregation
	process was simulated under variation of the typical colloidal parameters:
	the Hamaker constant A, the Debye length ??, and the ??-potential.
	The influence of these parameters on the mean final size, kinetics,
	and size distribution function of the colloid particles was studied.
	In the experimental section we study the system of cationic poly(diallyldimethylammonium
	chloride) (PDADMAC) mixed with an excess of anionic sodium poly(styrenesulfonate)
	(PSS) and varying NaCl concentration in the range CNaCl = 0.001???0.05
	M. The size of secondary PEC particles as a function of the salt
	concentration exhibited a pronounced minimum at CNaCl ??? 0.005 M.
	The influence of PEL conformation on the PEC particle size and the
	comparability of simulation and experimental results are discussed.

	weights, the sequence dependence of the mobility, and the diffusion
	coefficients of small single- and double-stranded DNA (ss- and dsDNA)
	molecules can be measured accurately by capillary zone electrophoresis,
	using coated capillaries to minimize the electro-osmotic flow (EOF)
	of the solvent. Very small differences in mobility between various
	analytes can be quantified if a mobility marker is used to correct
	for small differences in EOF between successive experiments. Using
	mobility markers, the molecular weight at which the free solution
	mobility of dsDNA becomes independent of molecular weight is found
	to be similar to 170 bp in 40 mm Tris-acetate-EDTA buffer. A DNA
	fragment containing 170 bp has a contour length of similar to 58
	nm, close to the persistence length of DNA under these buffer conditions.
	Hence, the approach of the free solution mobility of DNA to a plateau
	value may be associated with the transition from a rod-like to a
	coil-like conformation in solution. Markers have also been used to
	determine that the free solution mobilities of ss- and dsDNA oligomers
	are sequence-dependent. Double-stranded 20-bp oligomers; containing
	runs of three or more adenine residues in a row (A-tracts) migrate
	somewhat more slowly than 20-mers without A-tracts, suggesting that
	somewhat larger numbers of counterions are condensed in the ion atmospheres
	of A-tract DNAs, decreasing their net effective charge. Single-stranded
	20-mers with symmetric sequences migrate similar to 1 % faster than
	their double-stranded counterparts, and faster than single-stranded
	20-mers containing A(5)- or T-5-tracts. Interestingly, the average
	mobility of two complementary single-stranded 20-mers is equal to
	the mobility of the double-stranded oligomer formed upon annealing.
	Finally, the stopped migration method has been used to measure the
	diffusion coefficients of single- and double- stranded oligomers.
	The diffusion coefficients of ssDNA oligomers containing 20 nucleotides
	are similar to 50% larger than those of double-stranded DNA oligomers
	of the same size, reflecting the greater flexibility of ssDNA molecules.

	and double-stranded DNA molecules up to 50 000 bases or base pairs

	The Einstein equation suggests that the electrophoretic mobilities
	(mu) and diffusion coefficients (D) should be related by the xpression
	mu/D = Q/k(B)T, where Q is the charge of the polyion (Q = ze(o),

	electronic charge), k(B) is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the absolute
	temperature. If this equation were true, the ratio mu/zD should be
	a constant equal to e(o)/k(B)T (39.6 V-1) at 20 degreesC. However,
	the ratio mu/zD decreases with an increase in molecular weight for
	both single-and double-stranded DNAs. The mobilities and diffusion
	coefficients are better described by the modified Einstein equation
	mu/(ND)-D-m = e(o)/k(B)T, where N is the number of repeat units (bases

	The average value of the ratio mu/(ND)-D-m is 40 +/- 4 V-1 for 36

  abstract = {We have developed a theory for the extension and force of B-DNA tethered
	at a fixed point in a uniform hydrodynamic flow or in a uniform applied
	electric field. The chain tethered in an electric field is considered
	to be subject to free electrophoresis compensated by free sedimentation
	in the opposite direction. This allows the use of results of free
	electrophoresis for including the effects of small ions. The force
	on the chain is derived for a sequence of ellipsoidal segments, each
	twice the persistence length of the wormlike chain. Hydrodynamic
	interaction between these segments is based on the long-range limit
	of flow around the prolate ellipsoids, as derived from equivalent
	Stokes spheres. The chain extension is derived by applying the entropic
	elasticity relation of Marko and Siggia (1995 Macromolecules. 28:8759-8770)
	to each segment for polymer chains under constant tension. We justify
	this procedure by comparing with extension results based on the Boltzmann
	averaged orientation of straight, freely jointed segments. Predicted
	results agree well with recent extension-flow experiments by Perkins
	et al., 1995. Science. 258:83-87, and with electrophoretic stretch
	experiments by Smith and Bendich (1990 Biopolymers, 29:1167-1173)

	and electrophoretic stretch, proposed by Long et al. (1996 Phys.
	Rev. Lett. 76:3858-3861; 1996 Biopolymers 39:755-759), is valid only

	has been described earlier by Han and Craighead [Science 288 (2000)
	1026]: the chains are delayed at the entrance of the constriction
	and escape with a rate that increases with chain length. The other,
	actually dominating mechanism is here reported for the first time:
	some chains diffuse out of their main path into the corners of the
	box, where they remain trapped for a long time. The probability that
	this happens increases with the diffusion constant, i.e., the inverse
	chain length. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	thin films by the polyelectrolyte multilayering technique. All polyelectrolytes
	are assembled in the presence of added salt. Even highly charged
	polymers in the 104 Da range of molar mass exhibit atypical multilayering
	characteristics. If the molar mass, MM, of either of the polymers
	is in this range, the thickness increment realized on addition of
	the shorter polymer is partially lost on exposure to the solution
	of longer polymer, as surface polyelectrolyte is stripped off by
	its oppositely charged partner. Complete loss of low MM polyanion
	on exposure to low MM polycation inhibits multilayer growth altogether.
	The role of salt is elucidated in the balance between multilayer
	growth, which relies on kinetically irreversible adsorption, and
	polyelectrolyte stripping, which produces a stable solution dispersion
	of polyelectrolyte complex. Subtleties in the irreversibility of
	commonly employed combinations of high molar mass polymers are revealed

	by displacement of acid-base equilibrium induced by changes in the
	local environment provides a feedback mechanism that controls the
	balance between electrostatic, van der Waals, steric interactions
	and molecular organization. Which strategies do responsive systems
	follow to globally optimize chemical equilibrium and physical interactions?
	We address this question by theoretically studying model layers of
	end-grafted polyacids. These layers spontaneously form self-assembled
	aggregates, presenting domains of controlled local pH and whose morphologies
	can be manipulated by the composition of the solution in contact
	with the film. Charge regulation stabilizes micellar domains over
	a wide range of pH by reducing the local charge in the aggregate
	at the cost of chemical free energy and gaining in hydrophobic interactions.
	This balance determines the boundaries between different aggregate
	morphologies. We show that a qualitatively new form of organization
	arises from the coupling between physical interactions and protonation
	equilibrium. This optimization strategy presents itself with polyelectrolytes
	coexisting in two different and well-defined protonation states.
	Our results underline the need of considering the coupling between
	chemical equilibrium and physical interactions due to their highly
	nonadditive behavior. The predictions provide guidelines for the
	creation of responsive polymer layers presenting self-organized patterns
	with functional properties and they give insights for the understanding
	of competing interactions in highly inhomogeneous and constrained
	environments such as those relevant in nanotechnology and those responsible
	for biological cells function.},

	The linearization of the mean-field PB functional yields linearized
	Debye-H{\"u}ckel-type equations agreeing asymptotically with the
	nonlinear PB results in the weak-coupling (high-temperature) limit.
	Both the canonical (fixed number of microions) as well as the semigrand-canonical
	(in contact with an infinite salt reservoir) cases are considered
	and discussed in a unified linearized framework. In disagreement
	with the exact nonlinear PB solution inside a Wigner-Seitz cell,
	the linearized theory predicts the occurrence of a thermodynamical
	instability with an associated phase separation of the homogeneous

	a spurious result of the linearization. We show that these artifacts,
	although thermodynamically consistent with quadratic expansions of
	the nonlinear functional and osmotic pressure, may be traced back
	to the nonfulfillment of the underlying assumptions of the linearization.
	This raises questions about the reliability of the prediction of

  abstract = {We extended a previous analysis of the classical Rayleigh instability
	of spherical charged droplets in the presence of neutralizing monovalent
	counterions [M. Deserno, Eur. Phys. J. E 6, 163 (2001)], by generalizing
	the problem for suspensions of aggregates with D-dimensional symmetry,
	corresponding for D=2 to infinite (rodlike) cylindrical charged bundles
	and for D=3 to spherical charged droplets. In addition, we include
	the effects of added monovalent salt and of dielectric contrast between
	the charged aggregate and the surrounding solvent. The electrostatic
	energy taking the microion screening into account is estimated using
	uniform profiles within the framework of the cell model. We verify
	the robustness of these results by also considering Debye-Hueckel-type
	microion profiles that are obtained by the minimization of a linearized
	Poisson-Boltzmann free-energy functional. In the case when the microions
	can enter inside the charged aggregates, we confirm the occurrence
	of a discontinuous phase change between aggregates of finite size
	and an infinite aggregate, which takes place at a collapse temperature
	that depends on their volume fraction and on the salt content. Decrease
	of shifts the phase-change temperature toward higher values, while
	salt addition has an opposite effect. We obtain analytical expressions
	for the phase-separation line in the asymptotic limit of infinite
	dilution (0), showing that the collapse temperature depends logarithmically
	on . As an application for D=3 we discuss the stability of the pearl-necklace
	structures of flexible polyelectrolytes in poor solvents. The case
	D=2 is applied to the problem of finite bundle sizes of stiff polyelectrolytes
	that attract each other-via, e.g., multivalent counterions-leading
	to an effective surface tension.},

	bicontinuous phase separation. We discuss the physical mechanism
	of the unusually fast lateral growth of wetting domains found by
	Wiltzius and Cumming, the thickening dynamics of wetting layers,

	on the roles of hydrodynamics. We point out a novel possibility of

	macroscopic domains and induce secondary phase separation. We also

	of these macromolecules are negatively charged rodlike assemblies,
	and lateral association is induced by a number of cations such as
	divalent and trivalent metal ions and homopolymers of basic peptides.
	The general features of bundle formation are largely independent
	of the specific structure of the biopolymers and the bundling agent
	used. They are also approximately independent of the concentration
	of macromolecules. However, a threshold concentration of bundling
	agent is required in order to form large lateral aggregates, detected
	by a sharp increase in light scattering and by electron microscopy.
	The threshold concentration varies strongly with the valence of the
	cations and increases with the ionic strength of the solution. The
	formation of bundles is reversible by polyanions such as nucleoside
	phosphates. This overall behavior is similar to the phenomenon of
	DNA condensation and can be explained by applying polyelectrolyte
	theories, including the concept of counterion condensation. Our results

	shares genuine local sequence motifs with Kcv. By a novel simulated
	annealing methodology for structural averaging, information about
	the structure and dynamics of the intracellular mouth was extracted

	site model) integral equation theory for the determination of the
	K+ free energy surface. Besides the wild-type analogue of Kcv with
	its experimental reference activity (truncated KirBac1.1), two variants

	by eight amino acids, showing inactivity in the Kcv reference system,
	and a point mutant where the kink-forming proline at position 13
	is substituted by alanine, resulting in hyperactivity. The computations
	reveal that the change of activity is closely related to a hydrophilic
	intracellular constriction formed by the C-terminal residues of the
	monomers. Hyperactivity of the point mutant is correlated with both
	sterical and electrostatic factors, while inactivity of the deletion
	mutant is related to a loss of specific salt bridge patterns between
	the C- and N-terminus at the constriction and to the consequences
	for ion passage barriers, as revealed by integral equation theory.
	The cytosolic gate, however, is probably formed by the N-terminal
	segment up to the proline kink and not by the constriction. The results

	and surfactants of opposite charge. The polyelectrolyte complexes
	(PECs), which are surfactant-free, form typical structures of a low
	degree of order such as the ladder- and scrambled-egg structures.
	In contrast, polyelectrolyte-surfactant complexes (PE-surfs) show
	a large variety of highly ordered mesomorphous structures in the
	solid state. The latter have many similarities to liquid-crystals.
	However, as a result of their ionic character, mesophases of PE-surfs
	are thermally more stable. Both, PECs and PE-surfs can be prepared
	as water-soluble and water-insoluble systems, as dispersions and
	nanoparticles. A stoichiometry of 1:1 with respect to their charges
	are found frequently for both. Structures and properties of PECs
	and PE-surfs can be tuned to a large extent by varying composition,
	temperature, salt-concentration etc. Drug-carrier systems based on
	PECs and PE-surfs are discussed. Examples are complexes of retinoic
	acid (PE-surfs) and DNA (PECs). A brief overview is given concerning
	some theoretical approaches to PECs and PE-surfs such as the formation
	of polyelectrolyte multilayers.}},

  abstract = {Multilayer films were assembled from a copolymer containing both weakly
	and strongly charged pendant groups, poly(4-styrenesulfonic acid-co-maleic
	acid) (PSSMA), deposited in alternation with poly(allylamine hydrochloride)
	(PAH). The strongly charged groups (styrene sulfonate, SS) are expected
	to form electrostatic linkages (to enhance film stability), while
	the weakly charged groups (maleic acid, MA) can alter multilayer
	film properties because they are responsive to external pH changes.
	In this study, we varied several assembly conditions such as pH,
	SS/MA ratio in PSSMA, and the ionic strength of the polyelectrolyte
	solutions. The multilayer films were also treated by immersion into
	pH 2 and 11 solutions after assembly. Quartz crystal microgravimetry
	and UV-visible spectrophotometry showed that the thickness of PSSMA/PAH
	multilayers decreases with increasing assembly pH regardless of whether
	salt was present in the polyelectrolyte solutions. When no salt was
	added, the multilayers are thinner, smoother, and grow less regularly.
	Atomic force microscopy images indicate that the presence of salt
	in polyelectrolyte solutions results in rougher surface morphologies,
	and this effect is especially significant in multilayers assembled
	at pH 2 and pH 11. When both polyelectrolytes are adsorbed at conditions
	where they are highly charged, salt was necessary to promote regular
	multilayer growth. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy studies
	show that the carboxylic acids in the multilayers are essentially
	ionized when assembled from different pHs in 0.5 M sodium chloride
	solutions, whereas some carboxylic acids remain protonated in the
	multilayers assembled from solutions with no added salt. This resulted
	in different pH stability regimes when the multilayers were exposed
	to different pH solutions, post assembly.},

	and molar conductivity change with temperature following the Vogel-Fulcher-Tamman
	equation, and the density shows a linear decrease. The pulsed-field-gradient
	spin-echo NMR method reveals a higher self-diffusion coefficient
	for the cation compared to that for the anion over a wide temperature
	range, even if the cationic radius is larger than that of the anion.
	The summation of the cationic and anionic diffusion coefficients
	for the RTILs follows the order [emim][(CF3SO2)2N] > [mmim][(CF3SO2)2N]
	> [bmim][(CF3SO2)2N] > [C6mim][(CF3SO2)2N] > [C8mim][(CF3SO2)2N],
	which greatly contrasts to the viscosity data. The ratio of molar
	conductivity obtained from impedance measurements to that calculated
	by the ionic diffusivity using the Nernst-Einstein equation quantifies
	the active ions contributing to ionic conduction in the diffusion
	components, in other words, ionicity of the ionic liquids. The ratio
	decreases with increasing number of carbon atoms in the alkyl chain.
	Finally, a balance between the electrostatic and induction forces
	has been discussed in terms of the main contribution factor in determining
	the physicochemical properties.},

  abstract = {Room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) are liquids consisting entirely
	of ions, and their important properties, e.g., negligible vapor pressure,
	are considered to result from the ionic nature. However, we do not
	know how ionic the RTILs are. The ionic nature of the RTILs is defined
	in this study as the molar conductivity ratio (Lambda(imp)/Lambda(NMR)),
	calculated from the molar conductivity measured by the electrochemical
	impedance method (Lambda(imp)) and that estimated by use of pulse-field-gradient
	spin-echo NMR ionic self-diffusion coefficients and the Nernst-Einstein
	relation (Lambda(NMR)). This ratio is compared with solvatochromic
	polarity scales: anionic donor ability (Lewis basicity), E(T)(30),
	hydrogen bond donor acidity (alpha), and dipolarity/polarizability
	(pi), as well as NMR chemical shifts. The Lambda(imp)/Lambda(NMR)
	well illustrates the degree of cation-anion aggregation in the RTILs
	at equilibrium, which can be explained by the effects of anionic
	donor and cationic acceptor abilities for the RTILs having different
	anionic and cationic backbone structures with fixed counterparts,
	and by the inductive and dispersive forces for the various alkyl
	chain lengths in the cations. As a measure of the electrostatic interaction
	of the RTILs, the effective ionic concentration (C(eff)), which is
	a dominant parameter for the electrostatic forces of the RTILs, was
	introduced as the product of Lambda(imp)/Lambda(NMR) and the molar
	concentration and was compared with some physical properties, such
	as reported normal boiling points and distillation rates, glass transition
	temperature, and viscosity. A decrease in C(eff) of the RTILs is
	well correlated with the normal boiling point and distillation rate,
	whereas the liquid-state dynamics is controlled by a subtle balance
	between the electrostatic and other intermolecular forces.},

	sulfonate was used under high salt conditions to preserve the solid

	the same time shielding it from the outer environment e.g., from
	protease or microbial activity. Decrease of the buffer salt concentration
	leads to the dissolution of the enzyme under formation of mu-bioreactors.
	The spherical mu-bioreactors are bearing an extremely high loading
	of biocompound per volume. Encapsulated GOD was subsequently used

	(i) a rigid polymer with rigid bonds (rigid rod); (ii) a flexible
	polymer with rigid bonds; and (iii) a flexible polymer with flexible
	bonds. The use of a very efficient pivot algorithm has made it possible
	to simulate very long chains, with up to several thousand titrating
	groups. The results have been compared to a mean field approximation
	for a rigid rod and variational results emanating from a Flory type
	approach. It is found that the rigid rod mean field model gives a
	qualitatively correct description for the apparent dissociation constant
	for all three models. At room temperature, the energy contribution
	to the apparent dissociation constant often dominates over the entropic
	term, which partly explains the relative success of this approach.
	In the case of flexible bonds, both the conformational behavior and
	the behavior of the apparent dissociation constant are well described
	by a variational ansatz with a quadratic term, largely thanks to
	the harmonicity of the bonds themselves. The approach is less successful
	for rigid bonds, which becomes evident for highly charged chains
	where a harmonic entropy term is incorrect. This can be remedied
	by replacing it with an expression valid in the strong coupling regime.
	Empirical scaling expressions have also been found, primarily for

  abstract = { The conformation and titration curves of weak polyampholytes are
	examined using Monte Carlo simulations with screened Coulomb potentials
	in the Grand Canonical ensemble. Two different types of monomers
	are considered. Depending on the solution pH, monomers A are weak
	acidic sites that can either be negatively charged or uncharged (as
	carboxylic groups), whereas monomers B are weak basic sites that
	can either be positively charged or uncharged (as amino groups).
	The influence of the chain stiffness, primary structure, and ionic
	concentration on the acid/base properties of the polyampholyte chains
	are systematically investigated. By adjusting the pH values, titration
	curves and then the fractions of positively and negatively ionized
	charged monomers are calculated. Stiffness influence is estimated
	by comparing two models of chain: a fully flexible and a rod-like
	polyampholyte. Different primary structures such as statistical (diblock,
	octablock, and alternating) and random polyampholytes are also considered.
	We demonstrate that the primary structure plays important roles in
	the acid/base properties as well as the charge distribution along
	the polymer backbone of a statistical rod-like polyampholyte. When
	flexible polyampholytes are considered, polyampholyte conformations
	promote the attractive electrostatic interactions between positively
	and negatively charged monomers, hence leading to more or less compact
	conformations and acid/base properties relatively different in comparison
	to the rod-like polyampholytes. Various conformations such as extended,
	globular, and pearl-necklace conformations are found in good agreement
	with the literature by adjusting the interaction parameter between
	monomers and monomer stoichiometry. },

	in ANSI C, originates from a parallel hardware project, and is well
	suited for parallelization on processor clusters. By careful optimization
	of neighbor searching and of inner loop performance, GROMACS is a
	very fast program for molecular dynamics simulation. It does not
	have a force field of its own, but is compatible with GROMOS, OPLS,
	AMBER, and ENCAD force fields. In addition, it can handle polarizable
	shell models and flexible constraints. The program is versatile,
	as force routines can be added by the user, tabulated functions can
	be specified, and analyses can be easily customized. Nonequilibrium
	dynamics and free energy determinations are incorporated. Interfaces
	with popular quantum-chemical packages (MOPAC, GAMES-UK, GAUSSIAN)
	are provided to perform mixed MM/QM simulations. The package includes
	about 100 utility and analysis programs. GROMACS is in the public
	domain and distributed (with source code and documentation) under

  abstract = {Abstract: The thermodynamics of hydrogen bond breaking and formation
	was studied in solutions of alcohol (methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol)
	molecules. An extensive series of over 400 molecular dynamics simulations
	with an aggregate length of over 900 ns was analyzed using an analysis
	technique in which hydrogen bond (HB) breaking is interpreted as
	an Eyring process, for which the Gibbs energy of activation G can
	be determined from the HB lifetime. By performing simulations at
	different temperatures, we were able to determine the enthalpy of
	activation H and the entropy of activation TS for this process from
	the Van't Hoff relation. The equilibrium thermodynamics was determined
	separately, based on the number of donor hydrogens that are involved
	in hydrogen bonds. Results (H) are compared to experimental data
	from Raman spectroscopy and found to be in good agreement for pure
	water and methanol. The G as well as the G are smooth functions of
	the composition of the mixtures. The main result of the calculations
	is that G is essentially independent of the environment (around 5
	kJ/mol), suggesting that buried hydrogen bonds (e.g., in proteins)
	do not contribute significantly to protein stability. Enthalpically
	HB formation is a downhill process in all substances; however, for
	the alcohols there is an entropic barrier of 6-7 kJ/mol, at 298.15
	K, which cannot be detected in pure water.},

	in Quickstep which is part of the freely available program package
	CP2K. The GPW method allows for accurate density functional calculations
	in gas and condensed phases and can be effectively used for molecular
	dynamics simulations. We show how derivatives of the GPW energy functional,
	namely ionic forces and the Kohn-Sham matrix, can be computed in
	a consistent way. The computational cost of computing the total energy
	and the Kohn-Sham matrix is scaling linearly with the system size,
	even for condensed phase systems of just a few tens of atoms. The
	efficiency of the method allows for the use of large Gaussian basis
	sets for systems up to 3000 atoms, and we illustrate the accuracy
	of the method for various basis sets in gas and condensed phases.
	Agreement with basis set free calculations for single molecules and
	plane wave based calculations in the condensed phase is excellent.
	Wave function optimisation with the orbital transformation technique
	leads to good parallel performance, and outperforms traditional diagonalisation
	methods. Energy conserving Born-Oppenheimer dynamics can be performed,
	and a highly efficient scheme is obtained using an extrapolation
	of the density matrix. We illustrate these findings with calculations
	using commodity PCs as well as supercomputers.},

  abstract = {The dramatic recent advances in molecular biology, which have opened
	a new era in medicine and biotechnology, rely on improved techniques
	to study large molecules. Electrophoresis is one of the most important
	of these. Separation of DNA by size, in particular, is at the heart
	of genome mapping and sequencing and is likely to play an increasing
	role in diagnosis. This article reviews, from the point of view of
	a physicist, the mechanisms responsible for electrophoretic separation
	of polyelectrolytes. This separation is mainly performed in gels,
	and a wide variety of migration mechanisms can come into play, depending
	on the polyelectrolyte's architecture, on the electric fields applied,
	and on the properties of the gel. After a brief review of the thermodynamic
	and electrohydrodynamic principles relating to polyelectrolyte solutions,
	the author treats the phenomenology of electrophoresis and describes
	the conceptual and theoretical tools in the field. The reptation
	mechanisms, by which large flexible polyelectrolytes thread their
	way through the pores of the gel matrix, play a prominent role. Biased
	reptation, the extension of this model to electrophoresis; provides
	a very intuitive framework within which numerous physical ideas can
	be introduced and discussed. It has been the most popular theory
	in this domain, and it remains an inspiring concept for current development.
	There have also been important advances in experimental techniques
	such as single-molecule viodeomicroscopy and the development of nongel
	separation media and mechanisms. These, in turn, form the basis for
	fast-developing and innovative technologies like capillary electrophoresis,
	elechophoresis on microchips, and molecular ratchets.},

  abstract = {Flexible polyelectrolytes of different sizes cannot be separated by
	free solution electrophoresis beyond a certain length exceeding a
	few monomers. The reason for this size-independent mobility is the
	equal scaling of the drag and driving forces with the molecular size.
	By selectively modifying the polyelectrolytes, this scaling symmetry
	can be broken and a size-dependent mobility can be achieved. We investigate
	the mobility of short flexible polyelectrolytes, such as single-stranded
	DNA, with and without a neutral label the size of a single nucleic
	acid. Numerical simulations allow us a systematic study of the microscopic
	dynamics of these systems and the impact of the neutral label, which
	is used to break the initial scaling symmetry, on the mobility. We
	find a free rotation of all the polyelectrolytes under investigation
	due to thermal fluctuations (this is in contrast to double-stranded
	DNA, where the fluctuations are less important due to its larger
	mass and charge per persistence length and where alignment with the
	external field has been observed). The impact of the neutral label
	can be observed as a systematic decrease of the mobility which becomes
	less pronounced for increasing total molecular size. This suggests
	that attaching a short neutral label will not allow for single base
	resolution of single-stranded DNA in free solution. On the other
	hand, the shift of the mobility due to the neutral label can be significant
	enough to utilize this method as diagnostic tool by specifically
	labeling only single-stranded DNA fragments with desired properties.
	Free solution electrophoresis experiments using single-stranded DNA
	fragments and biotin and trimethoxytrityl modifications as neutral
	labels confirm the numerical results.},

  abstract = {"The layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly of polyelectrolytes has emerged
	as a powerful and versatile strategy for engineering (bio)surfaces
	with active compounds. One possibility to engineer such films is
	to dope them with nanoparticles or with intact vesicles as carriers
	filled with the compounds of interest. In our previous studies we
	demonstrated that intact vesicles stabilized by poly-l-lysine (PLL)
	coating can be embedded in polyelectrolyte multilayer films made
	from the combination of either poly-l-glutamic acid (PGA) and poly(allylamine
	hydrochloride) (PAH) or from the combination of hyaluronic acid (HA)
	and PLL. These findings were empirical and not correlated to the
	interaction mode between PLL decorated vesicles (PLL-Lip) with the
	multilayer film. In order to produce robust and stable multi-layered
	nanocoatings containing intact vesicles, one has to understand how
	PLL-coated vesicles are integrated in the LbL architecture. To that
	aim, vesicle adsorption on three kinds of films, namely (PAH/PSS)12,
	where PSS stands for poly-(4-styrenesulfonate), (PAH/PGA)12, and
	(PLL/HA)12 was studied. PLL-Lip adsorption strongly depends on the
	interactions between PLL with both the vesicles and the polyanions
	used to form polyelectrolyte multilayers as was shown by direct evidence
	with confocal and atomic force microscopy as well as by the investigation
	of the interaction between PLL-Lip with the three polyanions in solution,
	namely HA, PGA and PSS. The latest was investigated by means of isothermal
	titration microcalorimetry. As a result, PSS in solution is able
	to desorb PLL from PLL coated liposomes, and on the other hand, PGA
	and HA can adsorb on PLL-stabilized vesicles without desorbing or
	inducing only partial desorption of the pre-adsorbed PLL. As a consequence,
	the (PLL/HA)12 film was found to be the best system among the three
	investigated combinations of polycations/polyanions for vesicle entrapment.
	The amount of entrapped vesicles is then proportional to the number
	of vesicle deposition steps and is increased for liposomes with higher
	charge. The release of a dye encapsulated in the entrapped vesicles
	could be induced by temperature changes which shows that for the
	HA-PLL combination of polyelectrolytes, the embedded vesicles retain
	their integrity below the main phase transition temperature. The
	temperature increase leads to fast leakage of liposome cargo while
	the film structure is not changed (up to 45 [degree]C) suggesting
	that the lipidic bilayer is destabilized by ionic contacts with a
	polyelectrolyte network of the film. The latest is supported by the
	fact that within increase of vesicle negative charge, the stability
	of film-embedded vesicles is decreased whereas stability of these
	vesicles in solution is increased.},

  abstract = {The molar mass distribution of a polymer sample is a critical determinant
	of its material properties and is generally analyzed by gel permeation
	chromatography or more recently, by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.
	
	We describe here a novel method for the determination of the degree
	of polymerization of polydisperse, uncharged, water-soluble polymers
	(e.g., poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)), based upon single-monomer resolution
	of DNA-polymer conjugates by free-solution capillary electrophoresis.
	This is accomplished by end-on covalent conjugation of a polydisperse,
	uncharged polymer sample (PEG) to a monodisperse, fluorescently labeled
	DNA oligomer, followed by electrophoretic analysis. The monodisperse,
	charged DNA "engine" confers to each conjugate an equal amount of
	electromotive force, while the varying contour lengths of the uncharged,
	polydisperse polymers engender different amounts of hydrodynamic
	drag. The balance of electromotive and hydrodynamic forces enables
	rapid, high-resolution separation of the DNA-polymer conjugates as
	a function of the size of the uncharged PEG tail. This provides a
	profile of the molar mass distribution of the original polymer sample
	that can be detected by laser-induced fluorescence through excitation
	of the dye-labeled DNA. We call this method free solution conjugate
	electrophoresis (FSCE). Theory-based analysis of the resulting electrophoresis
	data allows precise calculation of the degree of polymerization of
	the PEG portion of each conjugate molecule. Knowledge of the molecular
	mass of the uncharged polymer's repeat unit allows for direct calculation
	of the molar mass averages as well as sample polydispersity index.
	The results of these analyses are strikingly reminiscent of MALDI-TOF
	spectra taken of the same PEG samples. PEG samples of 3.4-, 5-, and
	20-kDa nominal average molar mass were analyzed by FSCE and MALDI-TOF;
	the values of the molar mass averages, Mw and Mn, typically agree
	to within 5\%. Measurements and molar mass calculations are performed
	without any internal standards or calibration. Moreover, when DNA-polymer
	conjugate analysis is performed in a chip-based electrophoresis system,
	separation is complete in less than 13 min. FSCE offers an alternative
	to MALDI-TOF for the characterization of uncharged, water-soluble
	polymers that can be uniquely conjugated to DNA.},

  abstract = {Hydrogels are hydrophilic polymer networks. Immersed in water- based
	
	 solutions they show an enormous swelling due to the inflow of water
	
	 into the network. In the case of charged hydrogels the polymer network
	
	 additionally contains bound charges which influence the diffusion
	of
	
	 dissolved charges in ionic solutions. The swelling of the hydrogels
	can
	
	 be influenced by various external stimuli such as temperature, pH
	
	 value, concentration of dissolved ions in the solution, or applied
	
	 electric fields. By varying these parameters the state of the hydrogels
	
	 can be selectively affected. This accounts for the designation
	
	 'intelligent hydrogels'. Applications of this type of material can
	be
	
	 either as sensors e. g., for pH value or ion concentrations in
	
	 solutions (Gerlach et al., 2005), or as actuators e. g., as artificial
	
	 muscles or chemo-electric energy converters (Shiga and Kurauchi,
	1990;
	
	 Gulch et al., 2001). In either case the coupling of chemical,
	
	 electrical, and mechanical field variables is exploited. In order
	to
	
	 simulate the complicated behavior of hydrogels, a mathematical
	
	 description of the coupled three-field problem is necessary. In the
	
	 present work, an approach to a fully coupled three-field description
	
	 using the finite element method is made. The formulation of the problem
	
	 is based on the works of Wallmersperger et al. (2001, 2004b), who
	have
	
	 sequentially solved the three-field problem by first calculating
	the
	
	 coupled chemo-electric system and then using the results as input
	for a
	
	 mechanical analysis. As an advancement of this modeling approach,
	a
	
	 specialized finite element containing degrees of freedom for chemical
	
	 concentrations, electric potential, and mechanical displacements
	is
	
	 developed. It enables a fully coupled simultaneous solution of the
	
	 three-field problem and makes it possible to describe the hydrogel
	
	 behavior in sensor as well as in actuator-applications. The
	
	 implementation is conducted as a user-defined element in the commercial
	
	 software package ABAQUS. For the numerical solution the Newton-Raphson
	
	 method in conjunction with the backward Euler time integration scheme
	
	 is applied. Results for the electrical stimulation, proving the
	
	 applicability of the developed numerical model, are obtained.},

  abstract = { The influence of solvents (water, ethanol/water mixtures) on the
	stability and mobility of polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM)-supported
	lipid layers is investigated by the technique of fluorescence recovery
	after photobleaching (FRAP). Lateral lipid diffusion coefficients
	provide a measure of the interfacial interaction of lipid layer and
	polyelectrolyte multilayer cushion. An enhanced diffusion is found
	in solvent-swollen lipid layers in comparison to layers in air, with
	diffusion coefficients on the order of 10-10 cm2/s. The effect of
	solvent is discussed in terms of solvent molecules screening the
	interaction of lipid and polyelectrolyte. The results of lateral
	diffusion in water-swollen PEM-supported lipid layers are interpreted
	in a model of headgroup-interaction dominated diffusion, whereas
	the chains are disordered and do not influence the mobility. Diffusion
	coefficients are governed by the nature of the lipid headgroup, and
	its respective electrostatic interactions: The ionic phosphatidic
	acid (DOPA) couples more strongly to the charged environment than
	the zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine (DOPC, DMPC). The above model
	explains the stronger binding of the PA headgroup in layers in water,
	whereas for layers in air the PC headgroup has a larger interaction.
	The distance dependence of the Coulomb versus dipolar interaction
	accounts for these results. Diffusion measurements are further performed
	in layers swollen in ethanol/water mixtures of varying composition.
	At an ethanol content below 50% the layers are stable and homogeneous.
	The extent of screening of the electrostatic interaction by solvent
	varies with its dielectric properties. At an ethanol content above
	50% the state of PEM-supported lipid layers is inhomogeneous, which
	can be explained by either a partial dissolution of the lipid layer
	or a phase transition in the lipid layer. The findings on charged
	polymeric systems complement investigations of uncharged polymer-supported
	model membranes, and demonstrate the significance of local electrostatic
	interactions for issues of stability and dynamics. },

  abstract = {The physical behavior of polyelectrolytes at solid-liquid interfaces
	presents challenges both in measurement and in interpretation. An
	informative, yet often overlooked, property that characterizes the
	equilibrium organization of these systems is their membrane or rest
	potential. Here a general classification scheme is presented of the
	relationship between the rest potential and structural response of
	polyelectrolyte films to salt concentration. A numerical lattice
	theory, adapted from the polymer community, is used to analyze the
	rest potential response of end-tethered polyelectrolyte layers in
	which electrostatics and short-range contact interactions conspire
	to bring about different structural states. As an experimental quantity
	the rest potential is a readily accessible, nonperturbing metric
	of the equilibrium structure of a polyelectrolyte layer. A first
	set of measurements is reported on monolayers of end-tethered, single-stranded
	DNA in monovalent (NaCl) and divalent (MgCl(2)) counterion environments.
	Intriguingly, in NaCl electrolyte at least two different mechanisms
	appear by which the DNA layers can structurally relax in response
	to changing salt conditions. In MgCl(2) the layers appear to collapse.
	The possible molecular mechanisms behind these behaviors are discussed.
	These studies provide insight into phenomena more generally underlying
	polyelectrolyte applications in the chemical, environmental, and
	biotechnological fields.},

	+/- 5 base pairs, M(r) = 1.06 x 10(5)) with and without added salt
	have been studied by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The DNA
	concentration ranged from 30 to 182 mg/mL. The scattering intensity
	of salt-free solutions displays a broad maximum at scattering vector
	q(m), indicative of solution structure caused by the electrostatic
	and excluded-volume interactions between charged DNA fragments. The
	peak vanishes when enough salt is added that the screened coulomb
	potential becomes shorter range than the interparticle distance.
	q(m) scales with the DNA concentrations as C1/2. This accords with
	scaling theory and similar predictions and agrees with SAXS and small-angle
	neutron scattering results obtained by others on semidilute solutions
	of semiflexible synthetic polyelectrolytes. When account is taken
	of the expanded effective DNA diameter in no-salt or low-salt solutions,
	these solutions have number densities-rho above the limit (pi-d(eff)L2/4)rho
	> 4.48 predicted by Onsager to lead to a transition to an anisotropic,
	liquid crystalline phase. The peak spacing under these conditions
	is consistent with hexagonally aligned arrays. However, we observe
	no evidence of anisotropy. This may be confirmation of the suggestion
	by Stroobants et al. (1986) that twisting forces between charged
	rods (for which the crossed orientation has a lower energy than the
	parallel) raise the concentration required for the transition.},

	perfluoroalkanes primarily by fitting to conformational profiles

	and to experimental data for pure liquids. The ab initio C-C-C-C
	profile of n-C4F10 (perfluorobutane) is similar to those from prior
	high-level calculations and indicates the presence of gauche (g)
	and ortho (o) minima and of anti (a) minima slightly offset from
	180. Ab initio torsional profiles for n-C5F12 (perfluoropentane)
	and (CF3)2CFCF2CF3 (perfluoro-2-methylbutane) also show three sets
	of energy minima. Special OPLS-AA torsional parameters for these
	three molecules closely match ab initio and experimental geometries,
	conformational energies (Emin), and conformational energy barriers.
	These specialized force fields were merged to provide a generalized
	force field for linear, branched, and cyclic perfluoroalkanes. The
	resultant parameters yield key Emin values within 0.6 kcal/mol of
	the ab initio results for the three test compounds but more poorly
	represent the energy barriers. The parametrization also included
	reproduction of experimental liquid properties of these compounds,
	CF4 (perfluoromethane) and c-C5F10 (perfluorocyclopentane) via Monte
	Carlo (MC) simulations. MC simulations of six additional molecules
	were also performed in order to test the transferability of the force

	of imidazolium-based ionic liquids (ILs) (J. Phys. Chem. B, 2006,
	110, 12682), we report on the effect of cation variation on the frequency-dependent
	dielectric permittivity up to 20 GHz of ionic liquids. The salts
	are comprised of pyrrolidinium, pyridinium, tetraalkylammonium, and
	triethylsulfonium cations combined with the bis-((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl)imide
	anion. The dielectric spectra resemble those observed for imidazolium
	salts with the same anion. In all cases, the major contribution results
	from a diffusive low-frequency response on the time scale of several
	100 ps, which shows a broadly distributed kinetics similar to that
	of spatially heterogeneous states in supercooled and glassy systems
	rather than that observed in fluid systems. There is evidence for
	a weak secondary process near 10-20 ps. Perhaps the most interesting
	difference to imidazolium salts is founded in the missing portions
	of the spectra due to processes beyond the upper cutoff frequency
	of 20 GHz. These are lower than that observed for imidazolium-based
	salts and seem to vanish for tetraalkylammonium and triethylsulfonium
	salts. As for imidazolium salts, the extrapolated static dielectric
	constants are on the order of S 10-13, classifying these ILs as solvents
	of moderate polarity.},

	at low polyion concentration in which the high salt scaling of the

	polyelectrolyte is studied theoretically and experimentally. Self-consistent-field
	calculations were done to evaluate the charge characteristics of
	a model oxide surface in the absence and presence of a linear strong
	polyelectrolyte. The calculations show high affinity adsorption isotherms
	for the polyelectrolyte at different pH. At the adsorption plateau
	the surface charge is overcompensated by the charge of the adsorbed
	polyelectrolyte. The increase in surface charge upon polyelectrolyte
	adsorption is substantial. For a bare surface a similar adjustment
	would require a pH change by about three units. At a given pH and
	salt concentration the proton co-adsorption ratio increases with
	the adsorbed polyelectrolyte charge till the charge compensation
	point is reached and then it decreases again. The measured adsorption
	isotherms of linear poly(styrene sulfonate) (PSS) on hematite do
	not show a high affinity character. This might be due to fast flocculation
	and a non-equilibrium polymer conformation at the surface. At pH
	7 the adsorption plateau is reached and the surface charge is overcompensated
	by the adsorbed polyelectrolyte charge. The adsorption of PSS increases
	the surface charge, similarly as in the calculations. The increase
	of the surface charge with increasing PSS adsorption is about linear
	up to the charge compensation point and decreases beyond the charge
	compensation point.},

	Because of this difference, there could be concerns about the feasibility

	that the layer being deposited is stripping the underlying layer

	"successful" charge reversal. To address this issue, we used two

	between polyelectrolytes adsorbed on or in the microgel. However,
	with fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, we can clearly distinguish

	the microgel. Dual-color correlation confirms the presence of both

	of magnetic nanoparticles and a poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) microgel,
	followed by the assembly and characterisation of magnetic nanoparticles
	on the microgel. To facilitate this deposition, the surface of the
	microgel is first modified via the layer-by-layer assembly of polyelectrolytes.
	One advantage of this concept is that it allows an independent optimization
	and fine tuning of the magnetic and thermoresponsive properties of
	individual components (nanoparticles and microgels) before assembling
	them so that the hybrid core-shell structure retains all the individual
	properties. The decisive parameter when exploiting the thermoresponsive
	and magnetic properties in such hybrid core-shell structures is the
	amount of heat transfer from the magnetic core onto the thermosensitive
	(loaded) microgel (for the subsequent heat-triggered release of drugs).
	Inductive heat study reveals that the heat generated by the magnetic
	nanoparticles is sufficient to cause the collapse of the microgel
	above its volume phase transition temperature. Successful confinement
	of positively and negatively charged magnetic nanoparticles between
	polyelectrolyte layers is achieved using the layer-by-layer deposition
	onto the microgel. Dynamic light scattering measurements show (i)
	the presence of each layer successfully deposited, (ii) the preservation
	of thermoresponsivity in the coated microgel, and (iii) that the
	magnetic nanoparticles do not get detached during the phase transition
	of the microgel. Electrophoresis measurements confirm charge reversal
	at every stage of layering of polycations, polyanions and magnetic
	nanoparticles. This unique combination of thermoresponsivity and
	magnetism opens up novel perspectives towards remotely controlled

  abstract = {This study describes the surface modification of magnetic nanoparticles
	using two different approaches. The first approach consists of an
	in situ modification of the surface during the precipitation of the
	magnetic nanoparticles while the second approach consists of a post-modification
	of the surface after the formation of the magnetic nanoparticles.
	In the latter case, we adopted the Layer-by-Layer assembly of polyelectrolyte
	multilayers of poly(diallyl-dimethylammonium) chloride and poly(styrenesulfonate)
	to build a polymeric shell around the magnetic nanoparticle core,
	thereby intentionally conferring to this hybrid core-shell the same
	charge as the charge of the polyelectrolyte deposited in the last
	layer. Electrophoretic measurements reveal charge reversal indicating
	successful Layer-by-Layer deposition while magnetization studies
	show that the superparamagnetic behavior is not much affected by
	the presence of polyelectrolytes on the modified magnetic nanoparticles.
	Fourier transform infrared and thermogravimetry analysis results
	underline that the various polyelectrolytes employed, in both the
	methodologies adopted, were successfully bound to the nanoparticles.},

	fabricate a barrier layer onto the surface of Nafion membrane by
	alternate adsorption of polycation poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride)
	(PDDA) and polyanion poly(sodium styrene sulfonate) (PSS), which
	can suppress the crossover of vanadium ions. The Nafion-[PDDA-PSS]
	membrane ( = the number of multilayers) obtained shows much lower
	vanadium ion permeability compared with plain Nafion membrane. Accordingly,
	the VRB with Nafion-[PDDA-PSS] membrane exhibits a higher coulombic
	efficiency (CE) and energy efficiency (EE) together with a slower
	self-discharge rate than that of Nafion system. The highest CE of
	97.6% and EE of 83.9% can be achieved at charge-discharge current

	calculated. The simulations with both the polarizable and nonpolarizable
	model demonstrate the existence of an inhomogeneous interfacial structure
	normal to the surface layer. It was found for both models that the
	ethyl tail group on EMIM+ is likely to protrude outward from the
	surface. In the outmost surface layer, the cation is likely to lie
	on the surface with the imidazolium ring parallel to the interface,
	while there is a second region with enhanced density from that in
	the bulk where the cation preferably slants with the imidazolium
	ring tending to be perpendicular to the surface. The results also
	reveal that the electronic polarization effect is important for the
	ionic liquid interface. It is found that the cation is likely to
	be segregated at the ionic liquid surface for the polarizable model,
	while for the nonpolarizable model, the anion is found to be more
	likely to exhibit such behavior. The surface tension of the polarizable
	model (58.5 ??? 0.5 mN/m) is much smaller than that of the nonpolarizable

  abstract = {<title>Author Summary</title> <p>Many biomolecular processes involve
	charged species moving between regions of high polarity, such as
	the water phase, and regions of lower polarity, such as the lipid
	membrane. Due to the change in electrostatic screening between these
	two environments, the strength of the interactions between the moving
	charge and the surrounding molecules also changes. This has important
	consequences for the way biological activity is controlled. To help
	understand the forces driving the movement of biomolecules, we developed
	a computational model which is capable of describing these processes
	at near-atomic detail. To do so efficiently, we use a coarse-grained
	description of the molecules, in which some of the atomistic detail
	is averaged out. To capture the inhomogeneous nature of the dielectric
	response, we re-introduce some detail in the water model; the new
	model effectively mimics the orientational polarizability of real
	water molecules, and screens electrostatic interactions realistically.
	This enables the study of a number of important biological processes
	that were hitherto considered challenging for coarse-grained models,
	such as the permeation of ions across a lipid membrane and the rupture
	of membranes due to an electrostatic field, at relatively low computational

  abstract = {Permanently crosslinked polyelectrolyte gels are known to undergo
	discontinuous first-order volume phase transitions, the onset of
	which may be caused by a number of factors. In this study we examine
	the volumetric properties of such polyelectrolyte gels in relation
	to the progressive substitution of monovalent counterions by divalent
	counterions as the gels are equilibrated in solvents of different
	dielectric qualities. We compare the results of coarse-grained molecular
	dynamics simulations of polyelectrolyte gels with previous experimental
	measurements by others on polyacrylate gels. The simulations show
	that under equilibrium conditions there is an approximate cancellation
	between the electrostatic contribution and the counterion excluded-volume
	contribution to the osmotic pressure in the gel-solvent system; these
	two contributions to the osmotic pressure have, respectively, energetic
	and entropic origins. The finding of such a cancellation between
	the two contributions to the osmotic pressure of the gel-solvent
	system is consistent with experimental observations that the swelling
	behavior of polyelectrolyte gels can be described by equations of
	state for neutral gels. Based on these results, we show and explain
	that a modified form of the Flory-Huggins model for nonionic polymer
	solutions, which accounts for neither electrostatic effects nor counterion
	excluded-volume effects, fits both experimental and simulated data
	for polyelectrolyte gels. The Flory-Huggins interaction parameters
	obtained from regression to the simulation data are characteristic
	of ideal polymer solutions, whereas the experimentally obtained interaction
	parameters, particularly that associated with the third virial coefficient,
	exhibit a significant departure from ideality, leading us to conclude
	that further enhancements to the simulation model, such as the inclusion
	of excess salt, the allowance for size asymmetric electrolytes, or
	the use of a distance-dependent solvent dielectricity model, may
	be required. Molecular simulations also reveal that the condensation
	of divalent counterions onto the polyelectrolyte network backbone
	occurs preferentially over that of monovalent counterions. (c) 2008

  abstract = {The phenomenon of interdiffusion of polyelectrolytes during electrostatic
	layer-by-layer assembly has been extensively investigated in the
	past few years owing to the intriguing scientific questions that
	it poses and the technological impact of interdiffusion on the promising
	area of electrostatic assembly processes. In particular, interdiffusion
	can greatly affect the final morphology and structure of the desired
	thin films, including the efficacy and function of thin film devices
	created using these techniques. Although there have been several
	studies on the mechanism of film growth, little is known about the
	origin and controlling factors of interdiffusion phenomena. Here,
	we demonstrate a simple but robust method of observing the process
	of polyelectrolyte interdiffusion by adsorbing charged viruses onto
	the surface of polyelectrolyte multilayers. The surface mobility
	of the underlying polycation enables the close-packing of viruses
	adsorbed electrostatically to the film so as to achieve a highly
	packed structure. The ordering of viruses can be controlled by the
	manipulation of the deposition pH of the underlying polyelectrolyte
	multilayers, which ultimately controls the thickness of each layer,
	effective ionic cross-link density of the film, and the surface charge
	density of the top surface. Characterization of the films assembled
	at different pH values were carried out to confirm that increased
	quantities of the mobile polycation LPEI incorporated at higher pH
	adsorption conditions are responsible for the ordered assembly of
	viruses. The surface mobility of viruses atop the underlying polyelectrolyte
	multilayers was determined using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching
	technique, which leads to estimate of the diffusion coefficient on
	the order of 0.1 microm(2)/sec for FITC-labeled viruses assembled
	on polyelectrolyte multilayers.},

	We found that the 1,3-dimethylimidazolium salt shows the highest
	ionic conductivity among ionic liquids free from halogenated anions
	(3.6 x 10^-2 S cm-1 at 25 C), and the elongation of the alkyl chain
	causes the pronounced depression of fluidity and ionic conductivity.
	Also, such an elongation gives rise to the increase in the degree
	of ion association in the liquids, mainly caused by the van der Waals
	interactions between alkyl chains. N(CN)2 salts with 1-ethyl-2-methylpyrazolium
	(EMP) and N-ethyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium (PY12) cations as well as
	1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium (EMI) cation are liquids at room temperature

	cations, RT ionic conductivity follows the order EMI > PY12 > EMP,
	which does not coincide with the order of fluidity at RT (EMI > EMP
	> PY12). Such a discrepancy is originated from a high degree of ion
	dissociation in the PY12 salt, which was manifested in the Walden
	rule deviation and solvatochromic effects. A series of N(CN)2/C(CN)3
	binary mixtures of the EMI salts were also prepared. RT ionic conductivity
	decreases linearly with increasing the molar fraction of C(CN)3 anion.},

	molecular dynamics simulation of the ionic liquid dimethylimidazolium
	chloride ([dmim]Cl) have provided a structural description of the
	system at the molecular level. However, partial radial distribution
	functions calculated from the latter, when compared to previous classical
	simulation results, highlight some limitations in the structural
	description offered by force field-based simulations. With the availability
	of ab initio data it is possible to improve the classical description
	of [dmim]Cl by using the force matching approach, and the strategy
	for fitting complex force fields in their original functional form
	is discussed. A self-consistent optimization method for the generation
	of classical potentials of general functional form is presented and
	applied, and a force field that better reproduces the observed first
	principles forces is obtained. When used in simulation, it predicts
	structural data which reproduces more faithfully that observed in
	the ab initio studies. Some possible refinements to the technique,
	its application, and the general suitability of common potential
	energy functions used within many ionic liquid force fields are discussed.},

  abstract = {Light and neutron scattering measurements on highly charged polyelectrolyte
	solutions have recently provided firm evidence for the existence
	of ''domain structures'' containing many chains, even at rather low-polymer
	concentrations. In the present paper, we systematically investigate
	the influence of counterion charge valency Zc on the scattering properties
	of sulfonated polystyrene (PSS) solutions in water with monovalent
	and divalent counterions. This study is part of a larger effort to
	identify essential factors governing polyelectrolyte domain formation
	and the geometric properties of these transient structures. Neutron
	scattering measurements indicate that the interchain correlation
	length XiD within the domains becomes larger by a factor of 1.5-2
	for divalent relative to monovalent counterions. This observation
	is consistent with the Manning model estimate of the change in effective
	polymer charge density Tau* with Zc and with previous observations
	linking Xid from the peak position in the scattering intensity [I(q)]
	with the bare polymer charge density, Tau. Light scattering measurements
	of the radius of gyration Rg, XiD of the domains indicate that their
	size becomes smaller for divalent counterions and with a reduction
	of Tau. We observe that the ''fractal'' dimension of the domains
	measured from the low-angle scaling of I(q) depends on the chemical
	structure of the polyelectrolyte. Zero average contrast (ZAC) neutron
	scattering measurements show that the radius of gyration Rg,c of
	individual polyelectrolyte chains is also reduced for divalent counterions,
	suggesting that chain rigidity is strongly influenced by Tau*. Charge
	valency effects on relaxation times are investigated by dynamic light
	scattering. As usual, two diffusive modes are observed in the light
	intensity autocorrelation function, G(tau). The ''fast'' mode becomes
	slower and the ''slow'' mode becomes faster for the divalent counterion
	(Mg2+), relative to the monovalent counterion (Na+). Counterion valence
	has a large influence on the structure and dynamics of highly charged
	polyelectrolyte solutions through its influence on Tau*},

  abstract = {Electrostatic layer-by-layer assembly (LBL) is a versatile method
	of fabricating ultrathin multilayer films, coatings, and microcapsules
	from materials in solution, notably, oppositely charged polyelectrolytes
	in water. Polypeptides, a special type of polyelectrolyte, have recently
	shown promise for a range of applications in biotechnology and medicine,
	for example, artificial cells, drug delivery systems, cell/tissue
	scaffolds, artificial viruses, and implantable device coatings. Poly(L-lysine)
	(PLL) and poly(L-glutamic acid) (PLGA) at neutral pH are model oppositely
	charged polypeptides. Experimental studies have shown that PLL/PLGA
	multilayer films contain a substantial amount of beta-sheets. Here,
	we present findings of a molecular dynamics (MD) study of the physical
	basis of interaction between PLL and PLGA in multilayer film models.
	Simulations have been carried out to study structural and dynamical
	properties of PLL/PLGA aggregates in beta-sheet conformation. The
	results suggest that hydrophobic interactions, in addition to electrostatics
	interactions, play a significant role in PLL/PLGA multilayers. The
	preferred orientation of peptides in the beta-sheet structures is
	antiparallel within sheets and parallel between sheets. Intersheet
	hydrogen-bond formation is more likely the result of peptide association
	than the cause. The approach provides a general means to understand
	better how various types of noncovalent interactions contribute to
	the structure and stability of polypeptide multilayer films.},

	analyzed as a function of pH and KCl concentration using streaming
	potential/streaming current measurements. From these data, both the

	poly(acrylic acid) brushes are charged due to the dissociation of
	carboxylic acid groups and give theoretical surface potentials of
	160 mV at full dissociation in 10-3 M solutions. The surface conductivity
	of these brushes is enormous under these conditions, accounting for
	more than 93% of the total measured surface conductivity. However,
	the mobility of the ions within the brush was estimated from the
	density of the carboxylic acid groups and the surface conductivity
	data to be only about 14% of that of free ions. The poly(ethylene
	oxide) (PEO) brushes effectively screen the charge of the underlying
	substrate, giving a very low zeta potential except when the ionic
	strength is very low. From the data, a hydrodynamic layer thickness
	of the PEO brushes could be estimated which is in good agreement
	with independent experiments (neutron reflectivity) and theoretical
	estimates. The surface conductivity in this system was slightly lower
	than that of the polystyren substrate. This also indicates that no
	significant amount of preferentially, i.e., nonelectrostatically
	attracted, ions taken up in the brush. },

  abstract = {With the continued improvement of sequencing technologies, the prospect
	of genome-based medicine is now at the forefront of scientific research.
	To realize this potential, however, a revolutionary sequencing method
	is needed for the cost-effective and rapid interrogation of individual
	genomes. This capability is likely to be provided by a physical approach
	to probing DNA at the single-nucleotide level. This is in sharp contrast
	to current techniques and instruments that probe (through chemical
	elongation, electrophoresis, and optical detection) length differences
	and terminating bases of strands of DNA. Several physical approaches
	to DNA detection have the potential to deliver fast and low-cost
	sequencing. Central to these approaches is the concept of nanochannels
	or nanopores, which allow for the spatial confinement of DNA molecules.
	In addition to their possible impact in medicine and biology, the
	methods offer ideal test beds to study open scientific issues and
	challenges in the relatively unexplored area at the interface between
	solids, liquids, and biomolecules at the nanometer length scale.
	This Colloquium emphasizes the physics behind these methods and ideas,
	critically describes their advantages and drawbacks, and discusses
	future research opportunities in the field.},

  abstract = {In this Letter we report a simulation study in which we compare the
	solid-liquid interfacial free energy of NaCl at coexistence, gamma(LS),
	with the value that follows from the height of the homogeneous nucleation
	barrier. The two estimates differ by more than 100%. Smaller discrepancies
	are found for gamma(LS) of hard-sphere and of Lennard-Jones particles.
	We consider a variety of possible causes for this discrepancy and
	conclude that it is due to a finite-size effect that cannot be corrected
	for by any simple thermodynamic procedure. By taking into account
	the finite-size effects of gamma(LS) obtained in real nucleation
	experiments, we obtain quantitative agreement between gamma(LS) estimated
	in the simulations and derived from the experiments. Our finding
	suggests that most published solid-liquid surface free energies derived
	from nucleation experiments will have to be revised.},
