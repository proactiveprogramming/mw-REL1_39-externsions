== About ==

Mediawiki Ontology Convergence Assistant is a project trying to support
the use of the Semantic Mediawiki Extension (http://wiki.ontoworld.org) which adds semantic 
capabilities to mediawiki. MOCA provides an alternative interface when editing you wiki pages to
make the semantics easier to add and correct. For details and
further links, see http://sourceforge.net/projects/moca/

Notes on installing MOCA are found in the file INSTALL.
