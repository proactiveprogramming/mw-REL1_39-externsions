== Requirements ==

- MediaWiki 1.10.* or greater (tested up to 1.10.1)
- PHP 5.x or greater
- MySQL 5.x or greater
- JavaScript and cookies must be enabled on the client broswer


== Installation ==

(1)	Create a new folder in the extensions directory located in the root of your mediawiki installation and name it "MOCA". Copy all the extension 
	files to this folder.
(2)	Open the LocalSettings.php file found in the root directory of your wiki installation.
(3)	Make sure that you have already installed the semantic mediawiki extension before continuing further with the installation of this extension. 
	Follow the semantic mediawiki instructions on how to install the semantic mediawiki extension.
(4)	Ajax is not enabled by default so you will have to enable it if not already enabled. If you can find the variable $wgUseAjax anywhere in the 
	LocalSettings.php file make sure that it is set to true.
	$wgUseAjax = true;
(5)	Position you indicator after the declaration of the above variable and after the installation line of the semantic mediawiki extension that 
	usually looks something like this:
		include_once('extensions/SemanticMediaWiki/includes/SMW_Settings.php');
		enableSemantics('http://youwikiurl');
(6)	Finally you can now include the convergence extension with the following include:
		include_once( 'extensions/MOCA/includes/MOCA_Initialize.php');
(7)	If everything has gone well then the extension should work fine.
