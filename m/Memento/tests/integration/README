Welcome to the README for integration tests

Inside this directory are two useful files:
* integration-test-description.html - explains each of the integration tests and their associated dataset files
* how-to-read-output.txt - explains how to read the debugging and standard output containing the resulting header and entity information from each test run

Bon appetite!
