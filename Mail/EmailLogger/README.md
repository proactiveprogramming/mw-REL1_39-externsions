# EmailLogger
Logs email information being sent from wiki.

Developed by MyWikis LLC.

This extension logs all outgoing emails being sent from a wiki. This is used in cases where SMTP logs are not accessible (i.e. like in AWS SES) but need to be used to audit email sending activity and potentially identify suspicious spam activity on a wiki.
