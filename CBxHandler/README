CBx handler is an extention to mediawiki, it should be able to handle cbr and cbz files, but the cbz (and zip files generally) are not handeled with certain exceptions, and there is a bug report in that regards under https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T213841 .

otherwise, for this extention to work correctly, it needs the following softwares and packages

libfile-mimeinfo-perl
imagemagick
cbx-info
cbx-extract
unrar
