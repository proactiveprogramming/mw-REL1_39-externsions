BlueSpice Upgrade Helper Extension

This Extension is for Docker / Univention-App usage only.

This Extension offer a special page to save one upgrade token and replace bluespice-free with bluespice-pro afterwards.

This automates the recommended code checkers for PHP and JavaScript code in Wikimedia projects
(see https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Continuous_integration/Entry_points).
To take advantage of this automation.
  # install nodejs, npm, and PHP composer
  # change to the extension's directory
  # npm install
  # composer install

Once set up, running `npm test` and `composer test` will run automated code checks.
