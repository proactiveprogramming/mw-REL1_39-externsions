== Dia extension for MediaWiki ==

* Authors: (c) 2007 Marcel Toele (EleotleCram), (c) 2011+ Vitaliy Filippov
* License: GNU General Public Licence (GPL) v2.0 or later
* Description: Allows Dia diagrams to be rendered inside MediaWiki pages.
* MediaWiki: 1.16+

== Installation ==

* Install Dia on your MediaWiki server.
* Copy extension files to extensions/Dia directory of your MediaWiki installation.
* Add the following line to your LocalSettings.php file:
<pre>
require_once("$IP/extensions/Dia/Dia.php");
</pre>
* To handle gzipped dia files (they are also .dia), apply a patch to MediaWiki core. It will also enable gzipped SVG support (.svgz). Note the patch is only compatible with MediaWiki 1.21.
<pre>
cd <installation_path>
patch -p1 < extensions/Dia/gzipped-xml-types-1.21.diff
</pre>

== Usage ==

After installation, Dia diagrams may be uploaded and used as normal images in your wiki
(make sure you have <tt>$wgEnableUploads = true;</tt>), for example: <tt><nowiki>[[File:Test.dia|500px]]</nowiki></tt>.
They are rendered as SVG+PNG pairs on pages; browsers that can't show SVG will fall back to PNG.

An external program (Dia itself by default) is required to perform this conversion.

== Configuration ==

* $wgDIAMaxSize: Don't scale a Dia file larger than this value in pixels (default: 1024).

The following usually shouldn't be changed at all:

; $wgDIAConverters: An associative array linking your conversion tool (as key) with the commandline to be used for your tool. In this commandline you can use the following variables:
:* $input: The input filename
:* $output: The output filename
:* $width: The output width
:* $type: Thumbnail type
; $wgDIAConverter: The currently selected converter (default: 'dia').
; $wgDIAConverterPath: If the currently selected converter is not in the default PATH environment variable, you can set the path here.

== History ==

* 2014-01-16: Drop ancient MediaWiki (1.15 and below) support, do not force nominal diagram size.
* 2011-07-27: SVG+PNG rendering, gzipped Dia support.
* 2007-10-31: Initial version.
