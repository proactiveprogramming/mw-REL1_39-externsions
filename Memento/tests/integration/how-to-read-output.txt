How To Read Test Output Data

The test output data consists of 2 files:
* [TestClass].[TestName].[identifier].txt - just the header and entity output from the CURL command
* [TestClass].[TestName]-debug.[identifier].txt - all debug output from the CURL command

The "debug" files contain only headers and SSL information.  HTTP requests are indicated by lines starting with ">" and HTTP replies are indicated by lines starting with "<".

The request HTTP headers have the following fields of interest:
* User-Agent - set to "Memento-Mediawiki-Plugin/Test" to indicate to the server administrator our purpose for visiting the site
* Cookie - the session data used for visiting the site which has been anonymized for security purposes
* X-TestComment - indicates intent for this specific data set
