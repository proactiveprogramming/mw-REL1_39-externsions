# Gliffy Public

Gliffy Public is a MediaWiki extension built off of townsen's gliffy extension, which hasn't been updated to reflect the new edit link. Pull requests have been submitted there, but nothing is actively being done.

Currently, the extension only allows public documents to be embedded. Future plans to include OAuth integration to allow private documents to be shown.

Usage: <div id="gliffy-######"><gliffy did="######" /></div>
