The '''{{BASEPAGENAME}}''' extension adds some items to the personal URLs (the links which in the Vector skin are located near the top of the screen). While it is totally configurable, it comes with a default configuration that adds the following:
* A link to the list to all subpages of the user's home page.
* Links to subpages ''Home, Favorites, Sandbox'' and ''Notes'' of the user's home page.
At the beginning, the new subpages are filled with a configurable default text explaining their purpose. Each user can edit them acccording to personal needs.
