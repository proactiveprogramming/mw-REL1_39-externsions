== NamespaceData ==

The '''NamespaceData''' extension provides a way to define a data tab for main pages and user pages besides Subject and Talk tabs.
Only users in the new Data user group can see this tab and can change the pages in the Data and UserData namespaces.

This extension is a fork of the [[Extension:NamespaceRelations|NamespaceRelations extension]].
This extension is maintained at the same time as the [[Extension:LinkedWiki|LinkedWiki extension]].

== Use case ==

[[Extension:LinkedWiki|LinkedWiki extension]] allows the tag <code>rdf</code> to write with RDF/Turtle directly in a page (their ontology or their SHACL rules, for example) but people prefer to separate natural language from RDF/Turtle in their wiki.

== Installation ==
In your {{ll|Manual:LocalSettings.php|LocalSettings.php}}, the following line inserts a new  tab Data on all main pages and user pages.  you can give the right to users to see or not this tab by inserting a user in the Data user group.

<syntaxhighlight lang="php">
wfLoadExtension( 'NamespaceData' );
</syntaxhighlight>
