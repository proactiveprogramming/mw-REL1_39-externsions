# README-Standards.md

These are the standards for naming variables, directories, and files in extensions.

The goal is to following the standards that are used in the main MediaWiki application for the extensions, so the extension developers know where to find and place files.

==Directory and file structure==

- [ ] docs -- documentation files (user manual, technical specification, etc.)
- [ ] includes -- source code
  * specials
- [ ] languages -- language files
  * messages -- special pages
  * i18n
- [ ] maintenance --
  * sql
- [ ] resources -- 
  * assets -- 
  * templates -- 
- [ ] tests -- 
- [ ] vendor --
