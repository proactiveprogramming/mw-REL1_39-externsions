# OTTR Parser Extension

An extension for the ([Semantic](https://www.semantic-mediawiki.org/wiki/Semantic_MediaWiki)) [Media Wiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki). It parses text in the [OTTR template language](https://ottr.xyz/) and produces code in Media Wiki Syntax. Triples are represented as subobjects.

The help page for wiki usage: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Extension:OttrParser.


## Manual installation in existing mediawiki
If you have an existing mediawiki or need a specific setup you probably want to install the extension manually.
In that case see Media Wiki page of the extension: [Install Instructions](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:OttrParser#Installation).

## Full Semantic Media Wiki install with Docker

If you want to setup a new mediawiki with the extention you might want to use our docker image instead.

A [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/otautz/ottr-smw) of the Semantic Media Wiki with the OttrParserExtension and installation instructions are provided.

## Updating existing install

If you have a working mediawiki with **OTTR Parser Extension** installed you can easily update to the newest version.

1. use `cd $MEDIAWIKI_ROOT/extensions/OttrParserExtension`, where MEDIAWIKI_ROOT needs to be replaced by the filepath to the root of your mediawiki installation.
2. After that you can use `git pull` to get the newest Version of the extension.

3. Finally use `./setup_ottr_for_mediawiki.sh`to install the new version.


## Development

In deployment the extension uses the [includes/Hooks.php](includes/Hooks.php). It calls the python script [printOttrInSmw.py](includes/ottrToSmwPython/printOttrInSmw.py) from an installed python environment. You should use [setup_ottr_for_mediawiki.sh](setup_ottr_for_mediawiki.sh) for setting it up.
If you want to further develop this extension, it is advised to change the [includes/Hooks.php](includes/Hooks.php) such that it uses a direct python call without the installation as it is easier to test changes this way. 

All relevant source code can be found in [includes/ottrToSmwPython](includes/ottrToSmwPython). The script parses the text in the passed file and the Listener ([OTTRToSMWConverter.py](includes/OttrToSmwPython/OTTRToSMWConverter.py)) builds class objects (from the [OTTRClassesForSMW.py](includes/OttrToSmwPython/OTTRClassesForSMW.py)) related to the parsed text. 

The [SMWGenerator.py](includes/OttrToSmwPython/SMWGenerator.py) starts the generation of the final (Semantic) MediaWiki code based on the class objects and prints the result to the terminal. 

The Hook File reads the terminal output and returns the output to the media wiki page (with some additional information, e.g. the input text and wiki code in pre html-tags).


The source files in [includes/ottrToSmwPython/stOTTR](includes/ottrToSmwPython/stOTTR) are generated by [antlr4](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4). If you want to change its behaviour, e.g. use the lates [OTTR grammer](https://dev.spec.ottr.xyz/stOTTR/stOTTR.g4) you need to adapt [stOTTR.g4](includes/ottrToSmwPython/stOTTR/stOTTR.g4) and regenerate the files with antlr4. It is important to redirect the comments to another antlr channel like so:

```
Comment
 : '#' ~('\r' | '\n')* -> channel(HIDDEN)
 ;

CommentBlock
 : '/***' .*? '***/' -> channel(HIDDEN)
 ;
```

In the [Settings.py](Settings.py) you can add your namespaces, that are used in the automated forms, for requested arguments with the type restriction `ottr:IRI`.



## Ideas
* currently, it does not add new namespace ids to the wiki
