The '''RecurrentEventCalendar''' extension allows user to generate single or recurrent multiple event calendar pages with one form and query those events using SMW..

It was implemented by [[User:Michele.Fella|Mik]]. 

== Installation ==
{{ExtensionInstall
|download-link=[https://github.com/fellam/RecurrentEventCalendar/archive/master.zip Download]
}}

==Example==
List of sample templates, form, properties and reclink test page are included in the examples folder within RecurrentEventCalendar package downloadable from GIT.

===Wiki code===
<pre>
{{#reclink:
form=Event
|link text=Create event series
|link type=button
|iterator=date
|startday=Event[EventStartDay]
|endday=Event[EventEndDay]
|starttime=Event[EventStartTime]
|endtime=Event[EventEndTime]
|isrecurrent=Event[EventRecurrent]
|recurrentstart=Event[EventRecurrentStart]
|recurrentend=Event[EventRecurrentEnd]
|recurrentunit=Event[EventRecurrentUnit]
|recurrentperiod=Event[EventRecurrentPeriod]
|new window
|autofield=
|autofill=
}}
</pre>

== General syntax ==
In order to work users should define:
 
 * a Template for a single event representing the following information:
  ''EventStartDay'': Defines the day when the single event starts
  ''EventEndDay'': Defines the day when the single event ends
  ''EventStartTime'': Defines the time when the single event starts 
  ''EventEndTime'': Defines the time when the single event ends
  ''EventRecurrent'': Defines if the event is recurrent (it must contain one of the value '''Yes''' or '''No''')
  ''EventRecurrentStart'': Defines the start of the recurrent event (consider it as the first day of the recurrent event)
  ''EventRecurrentEnd'': Defines the end of the recurrent event (consider it as the last day the recurrent event can take place)
  ''EventRecurrentPeriod'': Defines the interval between the start of a single event and the next occurrence (it is a numeric value greater t han zero)
  ''EventRecurrentUnit'': Defines the interval unit between the start of a single event and the next occurrence (it must be one value between day, week, month, year)
 * a Form implementing [https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Semantic_Forms/Linking_to_forms#The_one-step_process|the one step process] mapped to the single event Template wich allows user to specify optional values if recurrent event. (see example)
 * a '''recinput''' button where the mandatory REC fields are mapped on the Event form. (see example)

{{Note|1=User should properly map semantic information within the Template in order to work with SMW.}}
{{Note|1=User would want to define semantic properties to limit the input possible values.}}
{{Note|1=Please consider that the examples templates, form, properties might need to be adjusted according to yout mediawiki configuration.}}
RecurrentEventCalendar are constructed like this:
{| border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" frames="border" rules="all" bgcolor="#ffffff"
|-
|<pre>{{#reclink:
form=Event
|link text=Create event series
|link type=button
|iterator=date
|startday=Event[EventStartDay]
|endday=Event[EventEndDay]
|starttime=Event[EventStartTime]
|endtime=Event[EventEndTime]
|isrecurrent=Event[EventRecurrent]
|recurrentstart=Event[EventRecurrentStart]
|recurrentend=Event[EventRecurrentEnd]
|recurrentunit=Event[EventRecurrentUnit]
|recurrentperiod=Event[EventRecurrentPeriod]
|new window
}}
</pre>

== Parameters ==
{| class="wikitable"
!Parameter
!Mandatory
!Description
!Notes
|-
||'''form='''
|Yes
|Shuold point to the user defined event form
|
|-
||'''link text='''
|Yes
|Sets the name of the reclink button which opens the form when clicked.
|
|-
||'''link type='''
|Yes
|Only '''button''' value allowed at the moment.
|
|-
||'''iterator='''
|Yes
|Only '''date''' value allowed at the moment.
|
|-
||'''startday='''
|Yes
|Form field name containing the start day of the single event.
|This must be returned also by the form
|-
||'''endday='''
|Yes
|Form field name containing the end day of the single event (if not specified it .
|If this value is not returned by the form this will automatically be assigned wiht the value of startday 
|-
||'''starttime='''
|Yes
|Form field name containing the start time of the single event.
|If this value is not returned by the form the time value will be taken by the startday field. If startday fiels contains no value the value 00:00 will be automatically assigned. 
|-
||'''endtime='''
|Yes
|Form field name containing the end time of the single event.
|If this value is not returned by the form the time value will be taken by the endday field. If endday fiels contains no value the value 23:59 will be automatically assigned. 
|-
||'''isrecurrent='''
|Yes
|Form field name defining whether the event is recurrent or not.
|Possible values should be '''yes''' or '''No'''. If none of possible values is returned by the form (or no value at all) the value 23:59 will be automatically assigned. 
|-
||'''recurrentstart='''
|Yes
|Form field name containing the start day range for the recurrent event.
|When page will be created this value will always be equal to the startday value (wether or not it is returned by the form. 
|-
||'''recurrentend='''
|Yes
|Form field name containing the end day range for the recurrent event.
|If this value is not returned by the form and '''isrecurrent''' value is equal to '''Yes''' an error willl be showed.   
|-
||'''recurrentunit='''
|Yes
|Form field name containing the unit between the startday of each recurrent event.
|If this value is not returned by the form and '''isrecurrent''' value is equal to '''Yes''' an it will take a default value of 1.   
|-
||'''recurrentperiod='''
|Yes
|Form field name containing the period of unit. Possible values are '''day''', '''week''', '''month''' and '''year'''.
|If this value is not returned by the form and '''isrecurrent''' value is equal to '''Yes''' an it will take a default value of ''day.
|-
||'''new window='''
|No
|Sets whether or not the form shuold be opened in a new window.
|
|-
||'''autofield='''
|No
|Sets fields to be used for autofill.
|Example of declaration is as param1:Form[FormField];param2:Form[FormField];.. 
|-
||'''autofill='''
|No
|Allows to overrive any of the form field after submission based on value matching rules.
There are four part in each rule separated by ":" and are target:formvalue:match:newvalue.
If formvalue is equal to the string defined in match the target field of the form will be overridden with the newvalue.
Multiple rules shold be separated by ";".
Within a rule use dot character for separate params and string.
The syntax should be autofill=target:paramX.paramY:"ValueToMatchForParamX"."ValueToMatchForParamY":ParamZ."a static string".AnotherParamValue."one more string".OneMoreFormValue;
|Use only String or Params in this fiels. All the Params shold be mapped in autofield with their corresponding form field from which the value will be taken.

=== Configuration parameters ===
The following settings may be used:

* $recgPageGenerationLimits to specify the maximum number of pages that may be
  generated per request by a member of a user group. If a user is in more than
  one group, the highest number is used.

  Default setting:

    $recgPageGenerationLimits = array(
      '*' => 0,
      'user' => 10,
      'sysop' => REC_NOLIMIT
    );

If you want to use these settings, just include them in LocalSettings.php AFTER
the require_once("$IP/extensions/RecurrentEventCalendar/RecurrentEventCalendar.php");
