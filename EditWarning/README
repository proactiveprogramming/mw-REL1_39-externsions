================================================

Author: Thomas David (nemphis@code-geek.de)

Licence: GNU GPL 2.0 or later

If the user opens a page for editing which is being edited by another user
at the same time this extension displays a warning on the editing page.

Notice: It's not recommended to use this extension if anonymous users
are allowed to edit pages, because it ignores anonymous page edits.

If you want to improve or extend this extension, fork it at github:

===== Installation =====

1.) Move the folder "EditWarning" to the "extensions" folder of your
    MediaWiki installation.

2.) Execute the following SQL statements in your MediaWiki database:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS editwarning_locks (
  user_id int(10) unsigned NOT NULL,
  user_name varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  article_id int(10) unsigned NOT NULL,
  timestamp int(11) unsigned NOT NULL,
  section int(2) unsigned NOT NULL,
  KEY user_id (user_id),
  KEY article_id (article_id)
);

ALTER TABLE editwarning_locks
  ADD CONSTRAINT editwarning_locks_ibfk_1 FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES user (user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  ADD CONSTRAINT editwarning_locks_ibfk_2 FOREIGN KEY (article_id) REFERENCES page (page_id) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE;

3.) Add this line to your LocalSettings.php:

require_once("$IP/extensions/EditWarning/EditWarning.php");

4.) Optional: The default timeout is set to 10 minutes. If you want to change
              this setting, add this line to your LocalSettings.php
              (Note: The value is the number of minutes):

$EditWarning_Timeout = 5;

Optional: The extension hides everything except the editor area. If you don't
like this behavior, add this line to your LocalSettings.php:

$EditWarning_OnlyEditor = "false";
