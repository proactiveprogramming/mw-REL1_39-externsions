 EditWarning CHANGELOG
================================================

Notice: I've written this extension for a MediaWiki installation I've
        maintained some time ago. Because I don't maintain it anymore
        this extension won't recieve any further major improvements or
        features. Even bugfixes may take some time. Please be patient
        or send me a patch.

           editing and has already locked the article for editing.

           locks of the user himself and/or of other users. This was not
           correctly handled.
