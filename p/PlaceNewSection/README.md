# Extension:PlaceNewSection

This extension introduces two magic words, `__ADDNEWSECTIONBELOW__` and
`__ADDNEWSECTIONABOVE__`, which control placement of new Talk: page sections. 

This is an updated version of the single-file PHP script currently found
at [Extension:PlaceNewSection][1] to support MediaWiki 1.3x and above.

## Progress

So far:

* it's been updated to use an `extension.json` and `ExtensionMessageFiles`
  within that to register the extension hooks and magic words
* it's been reimplemented as an auto-loaded `MediaWiki\Extension\PlaceNewSection`
  class
* explict GPL v2 license headers have been added to the PHP source files
* it's undergone some manual testing to make sure it works with MediaWiki 1.31
