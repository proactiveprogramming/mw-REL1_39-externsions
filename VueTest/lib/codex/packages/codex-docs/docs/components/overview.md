# Components

Components are the interactive building blocks of our design system, used to create consistent and powerful user interfaces.

The Codex library contains fully interactive components built with [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/). In
the future, some CSS-only components will be provided via [Less mixins](https://lesscss.org/features/#mixins-feature).

Each component in Codex has a demo page where you can interact with working examples, see code samples, and read detailed usage information.
