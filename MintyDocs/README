== About ==

MintyDocs is a MediaWiki extension that lets you store well-
structured documentation within the wiki by grouping pages into
products, product versions, manuals and individual topic pages.
It also lets you define draft pages, via a new "Draft" namespace,
which can then be "published" into their corresponding live pages.

The page structure of MintyDocs is based on that of the PonyDocs
extension, although MintyDocs has a simpler approach to defining
pages.

For more information on the MintyDocs extension, see its homepage at:

== Credits ==

The MintyDocs extension was created by Yaron Koren. Its overall
concept of four page types is based on the PonyDocs extension.

MintyDocs includes the jsTree JavaScript library (https://www.jstree.com/),
which is distributed under the MIT license.
