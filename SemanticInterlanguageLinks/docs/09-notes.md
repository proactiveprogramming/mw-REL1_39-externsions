## Components

### InterlanguageLinksLookup

`InterlanguageLinksLookup` is the most critical component of SIL as it combines the store
interface with the cache interface.

Any request either for a target link or language code lookup are channelled
through this class in order to make a decision whether to use an existing
cache entry or to make a "fresh" query request to the storage back-end.

No other component of SIL should communicate to the store directly and let
the lookup class to handle those requests.

### LanguageTargetLinksCache

In order to keep a page view responsive and avoid a repetitive or exhausting query process,
`LanguageTargetLinksCache` is expected to cache all objects necessary and be accessible
through the `InterlanguageLinksLookup` class.

It is recommended that the cache uses a "Composite" approach in order for short-lived
requests to be stored in-memory while other information are stored on a
persistence layer to increase lookup performance for succeeding requests.
